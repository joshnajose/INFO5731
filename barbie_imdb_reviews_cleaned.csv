"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.",beauti film preachi,margot best she given film disappoint it market fun quirki satir homag movi it start way end overdramat speech end clearli tri make audienc feel someth left everyon feel confus and say im crotcheti old man im woman im pretti sure im movi target audienc the saddest part parent kid theater victim poor market kid movi overal humor fun occas film beauti look whole concept fall apart second half film becom piti parti strong woman
A Hot Pink Mess,"Before making Barbie (2023), Greta Gerwig single-handedly directed two films: Lady Bird (2017) and Little Women (2019). Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence, both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother-daughter relationships, both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue. Both were very, very good. Given those credentials, one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent, convincing and amusing a picture - and, well, it isn't.The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land, a place where Barbie (played by Margot Robbie) is having the best day every day, in the company of other Barbies and, occasionally, Kens. The designs, costumes, and cinematography do an excellent job re-creating the Mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection. The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film; it is smartly self-aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything - a President, a Physicist, a Journalist, a Lawyer, or a Mermaid. Much like with the original toys, Ken (Ryan Gosling) comes as an afterthought and 'only exists within the warmth of Barbie's gaze'.The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and, normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet, she feels her heels hit the ground. What follows is The Wizard of Oz (1939) journey in reverse (the parallel is explicit) and, ultimately, a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World.If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit - as promised by the trailer - it could be an interesting exploration in the way of The Truman Show (1998) or Stranger Than Fiction (2006). Instead, the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts, threats, and plot-lines that are never fully realised. What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World? What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box? Why is Gloria (America Ferrera), the receptionist at the Mattel headquarters and, later, Barbie's Real-World companion, depressed - and how is that eventually resolved? Why is Gloria's daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) cross with her mother? Why does the board of Mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes? Most importantly, the crux of the third-act conflict - set in Barbie Land now renamed 'Kendom' - contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants.Towards the finale, the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles. One side is presented as clueless and attention-seeking, while the other is manipulative and vengeful. The film repeatedly takes offence with 'mansplaining', yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer. Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown, and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience, rather than on storytelling. While the denouement includes one of the film's highlights, the musical number 'I'm Just Ken', the ending does not resolve (or acknowledge) much, and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive.Barbie is very easy on the eye, and the acting ranges from competent to inspired, with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as Barbie, and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart, often stealing the show. Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land, while some of the bon mots are funny, yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters.If only this were better written.

Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end. But I guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings.",could have been great nd half bring it down,the qualiti humor write movi fun it quirki uniqu when get weed tri explor deeper theme movi miss the middl exposit phase movi i must say boreth movi close great incap deliv messag without charact liter give speech worth dialoguewhat could great satir began cleverli funni movi turn preachi moral movi end but i guess charm first half movi made shortcom
"As a guy I felt some discomfort, and that's ok.","As much as it pains me to give a movie called ""Barbie"" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I'm a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were ""allowed"" to have ""real jobs"" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.",a guy i felt discomfort that ok,a much pain give movi call barbi i it brilliantli handl fine craft i give filmak credit ye i somewhat conserv person former law enforc offic im guy i like guy thing hell i even enjoy battleship movi year ago absolut ridicul fun romp action film but i also like experi perspect and man oh man movi deliv spade pretti much encapsul everyth wife tri convey entir career life experi wrap two hour the humor set act abil weav current narr stori perfect i dont agre point movi that ok thi movi wasnt design give balanc perspect men versu woman noholdsbar unapologet crazi ride rant real issu woman face sinc allow real job thing men give well done film blast watch make think done place creativ passion attent detail ill call masterpiec
Too heavy handed,"As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the ""stereotypical Barbie"" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are ""brainwashed"" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.The movie's solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn't the point if gender equality... equality?The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don't add much, and not much changes in the end.What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia.",too heavi hand,a woman grew barbi i excit movi i curiou see would evolv stereotyp barbi someth but messag movi heavi hand complet lost plot i consid propon gender equal aint way get itbarbieland flip script patriarchi real world give woman power leav ken attract accessori onc ken get glimps real world bring patriarchi barbieland barbi brainwash happen suddenli without much explan the ken bumbl fool zero understand govern barbieland fall disarrayth movi solut barbi give lot ted talk patriarchi fool ken war rule but isnt point gender equal equalityth feminist messag could much effect laid thick more humor nuanc plea the stori get lost real world charact dont add much much chang endwhat enjoy act set cours nostalgia
Well this really did come as a surprise.,"It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.Bright, garish and somewhat kitsch, those were my expectations, and sure it's a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows, but what I wasn't expecting, was for the film to be so engaging, there's actually some real depth that I wasn't expecting. That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this. Greta Gerwig did a great job.Margot Robbie is glorious as Barbie, Ryan Gosling was great I thought. The pair shared some terrific scenes, real chemistry, and plenty of cutting one liners.Great use of music, everything fitted into the film so well.8/10.",well realli come surpris,it pain say i enjoy movi much i expect music number humour truli someth whole famili yo enjoybright garish somewhat kitsch expect sure verit cornucopia glitter rainbow i wasnt expect film engag there actual real depth i wasnt expect that open introduct came major surpris pretti much set toneof cours plenti doubl entendr laugh adult enjoy kid doubt chuckl away tooim pretti sure film go win award product well made creativ design visual lot thought gone greta gerwig great jobmargot robbi gloriou barbi ryan gosl great i thought the pair share terrif scene real chemistri plenti cut one linersgreat use music everyth fit film well
3 reasons FOR seeing it and 1 reason AGAINST.,"The first reason to go see it:It's good fun. It's fairytale comedy, over the top, pastiche and it works! It simply does! Margot Robie and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry. Everybody sorta agrees on that.Kids are probably not the target audience, although if they would watch it, they wouldnt be shocked or something, they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenes.The second reason to go see it:It really looks the part. I am not into sets or costumes in particular (at all), but I was impressed with the fun world they had created. It really looks fabulous and I really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finish.The third and best reason to go see it:I am a dude and I honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife. But I honestly did not expect this sugarcoated, fairytale Barbieworld to touch my heart in the end, but it did! What the what!They somehow created a finale, that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe. You cant wish for more than that. As a dude watching a Barbie picture. Hello!The only reason AGAINST seeing it:If you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women, then better not go see it, because all the men are (hilarious) loosers and whiners in this movie, with a brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby, who just cant get Barbie to love him.Feared the worst, but in the end I was pleasantly suprised. It's certainly not a brilliant movie, but it is a perfect summer escape movie, with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe!",reason for see reason against,the first reason go see itit good fun it fairytal comedi top pastich work it simpli margot robi ryan gosl great chemistri everybodi sorta agre thatkid probabl target audienc although would watch wouldnt shock someth would mere miss social gender issu joke mani scenesth second reason go see itit realli look part i set costum particular i impress fun world creat it realli look fabul i realli appreci movi eyecandi start till finishth third best reason go see iti dude i honestli fear worst go along wife but i honestli expect sugarco fairytal barbieworld touch heart end what whatthey somehow creat final gave goosebump terrif feel good vibe you cant wish a dude watch barbi pictur helloth reason against see itif dude dont like men portray weak emot inferior woman better go see men hilari looser whiner movi brilliant perform ryan gosl insecur crybabi cant get barbi love himfear worst end i pleasantli supris it certainli brilliant movi perfect summer escap movi lot joke wonder feel good vibe
It was depressing,"I thought this would be so much different. The ending made me feel sad and empty. Ken and Barbie don't end up together and they made Ken seem like a complete idiot. Actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie. And I'm not a man but that's just not true. It was depressing and sad and never the way Barbie was created for. I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it. The only good thing is that the Barbie aesthetic was beautifully done.I just do not like the way they presented men, it's almost like they want women to turn against men. Which in that case the point of the movie is very degrading for many people.",it depress,i thought would much differ the end made feel sad empti ken barbi dont end togeth made ken seem like complet idiot actual present men dumb throughout whole movi and im man that true it depress sad never way barbi creat i know lot peopl wont agre that okay pointless go see the good thing barbi aesthet beauti donei like way present men almost like want woman turn men which case point movi degrad mani peopl
My mom and I saw this yesterday. Here are my thoughts.,"I don't know if I put spoilers in here. I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see.",my mom i saw yesterday here thought,i dont know i put spoiler i super worn haha so i put i didi clue movi like it seem like strang differ type movi to go kind movi kid tell everyth perfect it noth like thatther coupl young teen girl right mom i felt weird know there way i would bring kid teen see thisth movi realli focus polit gender view so one total surpris mether point i kind roll eye a bit sing kind went there also time i tearyther sexual refer young kid would understand but one part tell specif thing specif thing ken bit strangeth end threw here movi seem say equal treat way yet time seem make men mindless idiot also someth one male charact ask end repli woman give seem lead one believ thing exact but unlik way thing seem barbi land woman men i didnt realli get then may last line movi place barbi somewher i didnt get point iti heard adult laugh repeatedli the kid kind sat silentthi one movi i see everi watch but fun uniqu see theater also i dug set design stuff barbi world it cool see
The marketing was more entertaining than the actual movie,"I went to see this today, everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastel-colored camp for two hours. BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.Despite all this, the movie as a whole was disappointing. As much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers, its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat. The messaging is so on the nose, spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain. Not that these scenes can't be funny or hit home (the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks), but a little subtlety could not have hurt.I also had issues with the differences between Barbieland and the real world. I can accept everyone in Barbieland talking in what many term ""Marvel speak."" If you've watched anything made in the past 15 years you'll recognize it right away: ""You know, we make all these pop culture references (like Spiderman in the MCU with ALIENS) and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because it's so awkward that it's funny... oooor it WAS when it was novel and new years ago. Now it's staler than a can of Pepsi Clear. Oh yeah-- I remember the 90s! Macarena!""The Barbies and Kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance. However, the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite-- messy, complicated, not that charming. Why are they also talking like that? It just feels lazy.And then there are the existential themes: Margot Robie's Barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise. At the end, she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning. A decent theme. Too bad the movie never really delves into it. It's given lip service, nothing more.It had some cute moments but honestly, the end experience was meh. The hype was more memorable than the finished product.",the market entertain actual movi,i went see today everyon group dress pink readi least entertain pastelcolor camp two hour barbi kind succe i love costum set barbieland margot robi fantast actress perfect embodi optimist shecandoital barbi ryan gosl scenesteal hors ob faux mink coatdespit movi whole disappoint a much succe campi comedi music number attempt feminist commentari existenti fall flat the messag nose spell right audienc one strain brain not scene cant funni hit home guitar gag gave colleg flashback littl subtleti could hurti also issu differ barbieland real world i accept everyon barbieland talk mani term marvel speak if youv watch anyth made past year youll recogn right away you know make pop cultur refer like spiderman mcu alien say think bluntest way possibl awkward funni oooor wa novel new year ago now staler pepsi clear oh yeah i rememb macarenath barbi ken suppos simplist figur sen emot nuanc howev human real world suppos opposit messi complic charm whi also talk like it feel lazyand existenti theme margot robi barbi get tire ideal independ womanhood etern paradis at end choos human embrac mortal mortal ultim give live mean a decent theme too bad movi never realli delv it given lip servic noth moreit cute moment honestli end experi meh the hype memor finish product
Barbie Is A Weirdly Fun Movie!,"8.5/10
While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice ""Barbie World"" song that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish ""What Was I Made For?"" tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly.",barbi is a weirdli fun movi,while im sure first movi kept get even fun entertain definit better also surprisingli deal legit seriou stuff barbi weirdli fun movi fill interest concept definit first time that ever done greta gerwig creat whole new style filmmak specif barbi intent weird yet creativ edit awkward cring scene found comedi funni instead cring barbi one origin movi year also one origin movi ive seen know margot robbi ryan gosl gon na carri movi will ferrel simu liu whole rest cast also great entertain soundtrack great except nicki minaj ice spice barbi world song absolut terribl billi eilish what wa i made for tune kept haunt background final get perfect scene play realli best thing song beauti emot anyway barbi lot fun still notic flaw found funni entertain colour creativ fun pure fun someth probabl love even second time see right barbi good time definit recommend movi somehow actual possibl liveact barbi movi need good writer good director good cast deliv mostli
"Brilliant observations, but social depth is missing","Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life, whether funny or deeply interpersonal, into a screenplay. Gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitions.Unfortunately, the only major weakness of the film, in my opinion, also lies in the screenplay. When dealing with larger societal issues, it lacks depth and possibly understanding. The observations work, but the contextualization falls short. The approach feels crude and superficial. This creates a confusing overall impression, as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing. A film that is so intelligent, funny, and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of things.Key moments in the film, such as the encounter with the inventor, fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere. The angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap. There seems to be a lack of sensitivity, as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligently.Any scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated, rather than being convincing parts of a larger whole.Overall, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the film. On one hand, I had a great time, but on the other hand, I left the screening with mixed feelings.Making it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board, with Ryan Gosling obviously standing out.",brilliant observ social depth miss,greta gerwig noah baumbach knack incorpor mani littl observ life whether funni deepli interperson screenplay gerwig manag direct great visual clever transitionsunfortun major weak film opinion also lie screenplay when deal larger societ issu lack depth possibl understand the observ work contextu fall short the approach feel crude superfici thi creat confus overal impress fine craft small observ remain convinc a film intellig funni creativ individu level suddenli seem foolish grand scheme thingskey moment film encount inventor fail evok emot come across insincer the angri rant struggl woman feel cheap there seem lack sensit someon want vent without make effort packag intelligentlyani scene trigger sen injustic express societ critic small moment longer feel precis may even intent appear exagger rather convinc part larger wholeoveral im entir sure make film on one hand i great time hand i left screen mix feelingsmak even confus consist brilliant act perform across board ryan gosl obvious stand
Somewhat of a Jumbled Mess,"My 15-year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my IMDB account.As a Barbie fan I was very excited for this movie. I was expecting a light-hearted goofy comedy. Instead I got a movie that felt as though it didn't know where it was going or what it was doing.The movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy, then things start changing.Things start going wrong for Barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it. She is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in Barbie Land. This on its own would've been enough for a movie, but it keeps going.Instead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for Barbie, the movie goes off in a totally different direction.Ken sees the real world's patriarchy and goes back to Barbie Land to replicate it. Barbie has to go back to Barbie Land to save it from its new patriarchy.By the end of the movie Barbie decides to live in the real world. The Kens of the Barbie Land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising. I find the treatment of the Kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movie's supposed messaging about equalityThis movies writing and plot were bad. Even as a feminist I acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy. I feel as though many of these different plot ideas could've been good on their own. They are just too confusing all together.On a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good. I loved seeing the plastic Barbie houses life-sized. The movie was also very funny at parts. I just wish the movie picked a clearer direction.",somewhat jumbl mess,my year old daughter wrote follow review post imdb accounta barbi fan i excit movi i expect lightheart goofi comedi instead i got movi felt though didnt know go doingth movi start fun goofi comedi thing start changingth start go wrong barbi go real world fix she suppos help person play fix problem barbi land thi wouldv enough movi keep goinginstead go depth life mother caus problem barbi movi goe total differ directionken see real world patriarchi goe back barbi land replic barbi go back barbi land save new patriarchybi end movi barbi decid live real world the ken barbi land basic back littl power upris i find treatment ken end hypocrit compar movi suppos messag equalitythi movi write plot bad even feminist i acknowledg messag terribl preachi i feel though mani differ plot idea couldv good they confus togetheron good note act set movi realli good i love see plastic barbi hous life the movi also funni part i wish movi pick clearer direct
Fun and surprisingly touching,"I was honestly doubting this movie at first, but surprisingly I find myself really liking it quite a lot.Set in the colorful Barbie Land, stereotypical Barbie lives a perfect life every single day. One day, she shows signs of being...a human. She decides to go to the Real World to find the cure in order to make herself perfect again.Barbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer. The set designs are eye-catching and on point as well. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling nailed their parts, but it is Gosling who mostly shines.Something I'm pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the Oscars, most likely for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and probably Best Song for Billie Eilish. That song is beautiful and it's stuck in my head right now.",fun surprisingli touch,i honestli doubt movi first surprisingli i find realli like quit lotset color barbi land stereotyp barbi live perfect life everi singl day one day show sign beinga human she decid go real world find cure order make perfect againbarbi fun movi surprisingli plenti heartwarm moment good messag offer the set design eyecatch point well both margot robbi ryan gosl nail part gosl mostli shinessometh im pretti sure movi get nomin oscar like best product design best costum design probabl best song billi eilish that song beauti stuck head right
Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",strong start that it,i walk theatr think yeah i good time movi but day went i kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi for part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life they also share coupl learn growth moment i thought would pay end filmi dont know i hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get u closer understand equal the barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film i knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form medium entertain recent in fact embrac so much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend and kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect i realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life and also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask
"Boring, mind-numbing drivel","I do not usually write reviews, but this is beyond description. Last time I wrote a review it was for the absolutely horrible wrinkle in time. This is almost as bad. At least Gosling plays his part well, but the story is abysmal. If you can find anything else to do like watch paint dry, then yes please do. You will save your brain cells the agony of a painful slow ..... nearly two hours long this was mind-numbing storytelling at its mediocre worst.

A Technicolor Dream,"Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with. Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter - how's that so tough to explain?Irregardless, I want to see this movie again.

Didn't live up to expectations,"I watched this with my wife who was ready to turn it off after about ten minutes, but I talked her into watching it - ""It'll get better, honey. They'll be going into the real world, soon.""Well, it didn't get better, after they went into the real world. I feel like it was a better show in Barbieland where it seemed more realistic.There isn't anything wrong with the acting or production, but the script is weak, particularly when they get to the real world. People just don't act like that. I'm disappointed for the actors, I think they thought it would be a great movie, however it's much more of a letdown.",didnt live expect,i watch wife readi turn ten minut i talk watch itll get better honey theyll go real world soonwel didnt get better went real world i feel like better show barbieland seem realisticther isnt anyth wrong act product script weak particularli get real world peopl dont act like im disappoint actor i think thought would great movi howev much letdown
You are Kenough,"This movie is so much fun. It starts off really strong although the story does move away from ""Barbieland"" sooner than I would have liked. Nonetheless, it regains its footing with the final act in particular and I could not stop laughing at Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken. That song will forever be stuck in my head.There are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience, that is if you're not an insecure middle-aged male terrified of women. I loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much more.I am excited to watch it again soon. The pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched, but purely as a cinematic experience I will never forget this movie.",you kenough,thi movi much fun it start realli strong although stori move away barbieland sooner i would like nonetheless regain foot final act particular i could stop laugh ryan gosl portray ken that song forev stuck headther also plenti good messag taken away experi your insecur middleag male terrifi woman i love everyth movi say patriarchi barbi grow consumer much morei excit watch soon the pace perfect huge potenti fulli match pure cinemat experi i never forget movi
OVERHYPED,"This is a movie that was way overhyped. Everyone kept saying it was so amazing, but when I finally go to watch it, it was not at all what I thought it was going to be. The storyline was not good. It was a basic and corny storyline, in my opinion.I didn't care for how they portrayed Ken. Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks. The way he acted as Ken was not that good either, but he didn't get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part. The movie had so much potential, but was definitely a let down. One positive is that it had some funny parts, but it could of been written much better and could of had a much better storyline!!",overhyp,thi movi way overhyp everyon kept say amaz i final go watch i thought go the storylin good it basic corni storylin opinioni didnt care portray ken ryan gosl amaz actor good represent ken come look actual ken doll look the way act ken good either didnt get much help writer way wrote part the movi much potenti definit let one posit funni part could written much better could much better storylin
Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari i expect funni cool deep entertain movi i highli disappoint the movi terribl preachi end embarrass we audienc brain plea preach somewher el furthermor movi divid unit and im woman the script movi horrend direct plain bad there great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world
Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.",ken ten,wow i see masterpiec come and that joke somehow greta gerwig took barbi made movi tackl realli tough social issueswel it crazi but wow work the stori matur thinker plot onc your done laugh butt youll get realli emot the product design point the whole movi pink everyth never polar all shade melt togeth plea way and cours cast margot robbi born play barbi hit home run ryan gosl thi dude rock ken he knock way around world hit back head he steal everi scene he i would board ken spinoff america ferrara simu liu also great respect role cast overal perfect overal barbi probabl best movi base toy sorri lego movi overal fantast time movi
I would have preferred to see this as a 30 minute TV sitcom,"Mrs. Shullivan and I enjoyed about the first 30 minutes of this full length feature film but after about the third song and dance number by the various Ken's we agreed that Ryan Gosling appeared to be the main character and not Barbie.Don't get me wrong, both Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie performed their respective doll like rolls of Ken and Barbie with a well balanced comedic and realistic delivery but when the producers appeared to display the Ryan Gosling ""Ken doll"" with an enhanced CGI eight (8) pack abdomen and bulging biceps we thought to ourselves that this was more of a vanity project for Ryan Gosling rather than an opportunity to reflect the changing world and the advancement of feminism through Barbie's vision of the changing world.The visuals in multi colored pastels reminded me of the 1960's Elvis films such as Blue Hawaii since Barbie and Elvis were popular icons within the same era. The downside of the Barbie film was that her message of being your own person and not being reliant on a man seemed to get lost by the multiple song and dance numbers provided to the ensemble cast of the male Ken dolls.All in all it was a decent film, not to be considered a future film classic, nor a memorable Ryan Goslng or Margot Robbie performance worthy of an Academy Award but just like Barbie it may be remembered today as a memorable place in time from a long past era. It would not surprise me to see a TV producer turn this Barbie film into a franchise merchandise bonanza and a weekly 30 minute TV sitcom which in my humble opinion is about all it could hold Mrs. Shullivan and my own attention for.I give the film a decent 6 out of 10 IMDb rating.",i would prefer see minut tv sitcom,mr shullivan i enjoy first minut full length featur film third song danc number variou ken agre ryan gosl appear main charact barbiedont get wrong ryan gosl margot robbi perform respect doll like roll ken barbi well balanc comed realist deliveri produc appear display ryan gosl ken doll enhanc cgi eight pack abdomen bulg bicep thought vaniti project ryan gosl rather opportun reflect chang world advanc femin barbi vision chang worldth visual multi color pastel remind elvi film blue hawaii sinc barbi elvi popular icon within era the downsid barbi film messag person reliant man seem get lost multipl song danc number provid ensembl cast male ken dollsal decent film consid futur film classic memor ryan goslng margot robbi perform worthi academi award like barbi may rememb today memor place time long past era it would surpris see tv produc turn barbi film franchis merchandis bonanza weekli minut tv sitcom humbl opinion could hold mr shullivan attent fori give film decent imdb rate
Not what I Expected,"I played with barbies a lot as a kid, so I thought this movie was going to be fun. The trailer looked great, I thought, why not, let's have a girls movie night, kick back relax, watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid. But I was greatly let down really fast. The movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is, what a man is, how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are. There was nothing in the movie that made me laugh. It all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling. It's definitely not a kids movie either, I don't think they would understand half of it.

Honestly - not funny and light enough,"I really enjoyed the first 20 minutes of the movie. It was very upbeat, positive and light. However, things soon became negative about 20 - 25 minutes into the movie. I couldn't stand it. Barbie's world and attitude was a constant bummer. Ken's attitude was sour. For the next hour (and more) the movie just lived in negativity.I bought tickets to this show a month ago. And, I saw it the day before the official opening day. I was very excited about this movie. And, I was playing the music (Dua Lipa) song almost every day. I was really excited for this movie - and was looking forward to something very positive. But, the vast majority of the movie was the ""conflict"" part of the writing. It was just too much! The movie didn't need to go that way, that far, that fast. I would have preferred a more shallow and fun Barbie movie vs. This Barbie movie filled with over an hour of conflict.",honestli funni light enough,i realli enjoy first minut movi it upbeat posit light howev thing soon becam neg minut movi i couldnt stand barbi world attitud constant bummer ken attitud sour for next hour movi live negativityi bought ticket show month ago and i saw day offici open day i excit movi and i play music dua lipa song almost everi day i realli excit movi look forward someth posit but vast major movi conflict part write it much the movi didnt need go way far fast i would prefer shallow fun barbi movi v thi barbi movi fill hour conflict
An Amazingly Perfect Blend Of Social Satire & Fun,"For a film like ""Barbie"" to succeed, every aspect had to come together perfectly. It needed to consummately balance satire with fun, the casting had to be spot-on, and the writing/directing required to pull off such a feat would need to be exquisite. Somewhat remarkably, that is exactly what writer/director Greta Gerwig pulls off here to create the best movie of summer 2023.For a very basic overview, ""Barbie"" sees its titular character (played by Margot Robbie) living her stereotypically perfect life in Barbieland. Well, that is until she is plagued by those pesky intrusive thoughts of death, a flattening of her perfectly-heeled feet, and a trip to Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) to figure out what is going on. As it turns out, a rift has developed between Barbieland and the real world that only Stereotypical Barbie--accompanied by Beach Ken (Ryan Gosling)--can mend. But when Barbie & Ken have extremely different experiences in the real world, it leads to even more messiness between the worlds that precipitates further adventure/hijinks.In terms of plot, somehow Gerwig manages to write and direct her way into the perfect tone with ""Barbie"". A mere mention of the term ""patriarchy"" in today's polarized landscape will more often than not lead to a line in the sand that neither side will cross, yet Gerwig perfectly examines and satirizes the subject by making the proceedings just so darn fun. Much like, say, Jordan Peele before her did with horror flicks like ""Get Out"" or ""Us"", Gerwig uses a genre other than straight-up drama to get her satire and story themes across here. Sometimes, that proves to be the best ""delivery service"" and it is certainly true in this case.Of course, solid/unique actors are required to carry out this quirky film's shenanigans and softer moments, and ""Barbie"" comes up aces in that department too. Robbie is perfectly cast as the lead, with both her beauty and dramatic acting chops lending themselves to the film's own dual nature. But more often than not it is Gosling who steals the show every time he's on screen. To do what Gerwig wants to do with ""Barbie"", the Ken role has to be perfect--and is here in the versatile style of Gosling (one of Hollywood's most underappreciated acting talents). The rest of the cast is also filled with solid performances and wonderfully fun cameos.""Barbie"" is just as much a visual treat as anything else--they didn't short the area of pink paint for no reason. DP Rodrigo Pieto creates a universe that is a sight to behold in every frame and then transitions some of those characters into a real-world environment with similar panache. All of this is of course given some drive by a killer soundtrack featuring the likes of Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, and even Gosling himself!Not only do I feel that ""Barbie"" eclipsed (even if narrowly in some cases) the bigger blockbusters like ""The Flash"", ""Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning 1"", & ""Oppenheimer"", but it subsequently vaulted Gerwig into the upper echelon of my must-see writers/directors (alongside Nolan, Villeneuve, Peele, etc.). After not knowing exactly what to expect from this film going in, I was utterly blown away by this experience.",an amazingli perfect blend of social satir fun,for film like barbi succeed everi aspect come togeth perfectli it need consumm balanc satir fun cast spoton writingdirect requir pull feat would need exquisit somewhat remark exactli writerdirector greta gerwig pull creat best movi summer for basic overview barbi see titular charact play margot robbi live stereotyp perfect life barbieland well plagu peski intrus thought death flatten perfectlyheel foot trip weird barbi kate mckinnon figur go a turn rift develop barbieland real world stereotyp barbieaccompani beach ken ryan goslingcan mend but barbi ken extrem differ experi real world lead even messi world precipit adventurehijinksin term plot somehow gerwig manag write direct way perfect tone barbi a mere mention term patriarchi today polar landscap often lead line sand neither side cross yet gerwig perfectli examin satir subject make proceed darn fun much like say jordan peel horror flick like get out u gerwig use genr straightup drama get satir stori theme across sometim prove best deliveri servic certainli true caseof cours soliduniqu actor requir carri quirki film shenanigan softer moment barbi come ace depart robbi perfectli cast lead beauti dramat act chop lend film dual natur but often gosl steal show everi time he screen to gerwig want barbi ken role perfectand versatil style gosl one hollywood underappreci act talent the rest cast also fill solid perform wonder fun cameosbarbi much visual treat anyth elsethey didnt short area pink paint reason dp rodrigo pieto creat univers sight behold everi frame transit charact realworld environ similar panach all cours given drive killer soundtrack featur like lizzo dua lipa billi eilish even gosl himselfnot i feel barbi eclips even narrowli case bigger blockbust like the flash mission imposs dead reckon oppenheim subsequ vault gerwig upper echelon mustse writersdirector alongsid nolan villeneuv peel etc after know exactli expect film go i utterli blown away experi
It could have been so much better...,"The film's universe and settings are fantastic. The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie. Instead, we're left with a film that almost divides and pits men against women, in an attempt to make it a feminist and political film.Instead of seeing a light, fun film, I saw a rather heavy-handed movie whose storyline is centered around patriarchy.It's a real shame, because the film's potential is pretty amazing. I came away disappointed, but not totally disgusted either.",it could much better,the film univers set fantast the cast realli good gosl excel role kenregrett howev film complet miss chanc appeal peopl grew barbi instead left film almost divid pit men woman attempt make feminist polit filminstead see light fun film i saw rather heavyhand movi whose storylin center around patriarchyit real shame film potenti pretti amaz i came away disappoint total disgust either
"""Barbie"" - A Multifaceted Exploration of Femininity, Consumerism, and Existentialism","I got free tickets for a preview and to be honest I was more than a little embarrassed to go. I did not tell a soul. As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.Anyway, I embraced the journey and I'm glad that I did. Here is my review written as a pretentious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:In Greta Gerwig's latest directorial venture, ""Barbie,"" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unravelling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig's live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie's role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I'm giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie.",barbi a multifacet explor feminin consumer existenti,i got free ticket preview honest i littl embarrass go i tell soul a cool middl age gentleman word got could realli affect street credanyway i embrac journey im glad i here review written pretenti critic i aspir next lifein greta gerwig latest directori ventur barbi esteem filmmak take monument task unravel enigma barbi icon doll fascin polar societi decadeswith margot robbi eponym charact ryan gosl ken gerwig liveact rendit delv complex world barbi attempt extract deeper mean cultur phenomenongerwig master navig treacher water brand materi infus narr blend adventur comedi fantasi romanc the result thoughtprovok explor barbi role feminist symbol challeng societ percept feminin girlhoodcan doll imposs perfect featur smile perpetu happi truli embodi feminist idealsgerwig compel audienc contempl question weav throughout fabric filmin realiti margot robbi domin film expect develop true cinemat icon the flm fun far expect henc im give boast i watch barbi
Could be better,"Completely forgot to review this, the sets are easily the best they're really gorgeous to look at, the characters are fun to watch and the characters are all really enjoyable. The movie gets a bit preachy but only for one scene, I also think the movie is slightly contradictive as every male character is treated as dumb and arrogant despite them promoting equality. It's done for jokes though so I know it's not meant to be an actual message with the humour, I just think it weakens the messaging of the film, it's still a really really good film the ending is super sweet and meaningful and overall it's a great movie especially considering this is a movie about barbie dolls lmao, I personally didn't find it to funny but I still appreciate it for its charm and most of its storytelling.",could better,complet forgot review set easili best theyr realli gorgeou look charact fun watch charact realli enjoy the movi get bit preachi one scene i also think movi slightli contradict everi male charact treat dumb arrog despit promot equal it done joke though i know meant actual messag humour i think weaken messag film still realli realli good film end super sweet meaning overal great movi especi consid movi barbi doll lmao i person didnt find funni i still appreci charm storytel
The best version of itself,"Barbie is everything expected of it and so much more, a self aware and meta comedy made for fans and newcomers alike that's also incredibly profound, layered and really funny. It's the best version of itself and just immensely satisfying that the Barbie movie that got made on this scale is so weird and unique.Margot Robbie is perfect casting as Barbie, she nails the movement and switches between the eccentric Barbie Land and more emotionally tolling real world effortlessly. She has a terrific arc that's full of emotionally resonant moments and the almost parental nature with Gosling works beautifully.Ryan Gosling is phenomenal as Ken. Note perfect casting that gives him another welcome chance to move away from his usual introverted roles and tap into his impeccable comedic timing present in The Nice Guys, only here it's dialed up to eleven. It all culminates in a musical number that is painfully funny.Will Ferrell is essentially playing Lord Business again and him and his whole team of execs are just as cartoonish as the people in Barbie Land but it actually really works as a nice bit of satire that emphasises just how out of touch all of them are.America Ferrara gets one of the biggest speeches of the film and really makes it work and her relationship with Ariana Greenblatt adds a lot of heart to the film whilst allowing it to have its both ways when it comes to acknowledging the history of Barbie.Greta Gerwig's direction is excellent, getting the bigger budget she absolutely deserves and uses every penny. Magnificent dance numbers, a fun car chase and a Barbie Land that is as vibrant as possible and despite fully embracing its own artificial nature it feels more real and visually stunning than so much of what's out there.The soundtrack is another standout element, a great selection of songs from some of the best artists currently working all at the top of their game.

"Amazing Cast & Set, but the political message was too strong","I've been excited for this movie for over a year. The casting was perfect and the acting was amazing! The set was next level, the tiny details were all there and even the highest barbie fan couldn't ask for anything more from it. It is PERFECTION.The first half of the movie was really good, a decent plot, plenty of laughs and a decent explanation of what is going on. Unfortunately, after a while it just becomes a rant about feminism & how oppressed women are. I'm a woman myself, and I'm all for equal rights, but the amount they shoved into this movie just overtook the fun completely, it felt very forced and by the end, you were left with the same feeling you get after scrolling through a toxic comment thread on a social media post. So sad.( SPOILERS AHEAD )Even more sad, the end message of the film when the barbies take back barbieland is basically that they are no better than the kens (or 'men') are. They manipulate them, undermine them, and then when given the chance to be better (the kens asking to have one ken presented in the Supreme Court which is all barbies), they laugh and tell them no, choosing to treat the kens or 'men' how they've 'always' treated women. So they are no better than the kens in the end. How sad! Isn't there a world where they can be better? Include the kens and all be equals?? What are we trying to teach young girls? That feminism is demeaning men just like we have been demeaned in the past? Also, I would have hoped we were past making a movie entirely about how 'hard' women have it. Life is hard for most people, men & women alike, and it's easier when we acknowledge that and treat each other like fellow humans instead of two warring species..",amaz cast set polit messag strong,ive excit movi year the cast perfect act amaz the set next level tini detail even highest barbi fan couldnt ask anyth it perfectionth first half movi realli good decent plot plenti laugh decent explan go unfortun becom rant femin oppress woman im woman im equal right amount shove movi overtook fun complet felt forc end left feel get scroll toxic comment thread social medium post so sad spoiler ahead even sad end messag film barbi take back barbieland basic better ken men they manipul undermin given chanc better ken ask one ken present suprem court barbi laugh tell choos treat ken men theyv alway treat woman so better ken end how sad isnt world better includ ken equal what tri teach young girl that femin demean men like demean past also i would hope past make movi entir hard woman life hard peopl men woman alik easier acknowledg treat like fellow human instead two war speci
"Funny and sharp first half, boring and baffling second one","I had great expectations for the Barbie movie, mainly because of the writers (Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach) and the stellar cast with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling leading the way. Unfortunately I found myself disappointed, bored and shocked by some messages the movie tries to convey.Starting with what I liked, the performances were great and in particular Ryan Gosling was spectacular with a wide range of emotions and a lot of humor displayed. Also the design of the sets was inspired with a lot of references to the Barbie world and the style was unique and recognisable. Finally some jokes landed pretty well and the movie (in the first half) is pretty funny. And the positives end here.Unfortunately the negatives are much more important. Sorted in a order of increasing gravity:
* some plot lines are bad and are closed so quickly that it would have been better not to include them in the first place. In particular I am referring to the mother/daughter one and the one about Mattel. Furthermore, the Mattel one is also a bit strange since it is useful to criticise however uses feminism to make money, while being a movie that does exactly that.* the film becomes boring in the second half. This is due to a systematic shift in tone and style since if in the first part the satire is sharp and elegant and leads to numerous bittersweet laughs, in the second half instead the movie becomes full of exposition. There are a lot of scenes where things are directly explained to the viewer (clearly considered a bit stupid) and there are some too long monologues that are both cringe and painfully written. This is a pity because some ideas explored in the second half are interesting, but due to this shift ""Barbie"" becomes so boring to enjoy them.* the messages: I found some messages the movie is trying to convey pretty baffling. First of all the film is not about parity, but rather about gender fight and I don't think this is the correct idea to give to younger viewers. I want that children/young adults get that as a society we want equal rights and opportunities, not to fight to be the dominant genere. This is also true because of the fact that there's no a single positive male figure throughout the movie because they are all treated like enemies or like total idiots. On the other side the Barbies are perfect entities. In a certain way it seemed ""Birds of Prey"" where the situation was exactly the same but in that case there weren't two of the biggest writer in Hollywood behind. Not to mention the totally worst thing that is how the Barbie solve the main conflict: instead of using intelligence they use seduction. This is so wrong because in a movie that wants to be empowering, women are depicted as better suited in seducing instead of thinking. All of these ruin other good ideas like for instance the inversion of the point of view that is useful to explain to men what women in our society has to live every day. That was pretty interesting but it gets lost between what mentioned before.In conclusion, I was very disappointed by the ""Barbie"" movie because I actually had high hopes knowing that it could have been a fun movie with positive messages, but it was the total opposite. I've seen it with both females and males and the reactions were generally mixed and no gender pattern was evidenced in terms of appreciating it or not. However the great merit that I have to give credit to the movie is that it triggers a discussion capable of actually enrich people through sharing of experiences.

"Now I am become Barbie Girl, the enjoyer of Barbie worlds","I have been waiting for this to release for so long and I finally got to watch it today. I absolutely loved it! It was fun, it had Margot Robbie (and extra stuff for Tarantino's out there if you know what I mean) And it had some absolute bangers! What more could you want from a new summer classic?Honestly the depth of the story ain't there but what do you expect from a film about a Barbie? Lol I'll probably go back and watch it again tbh and I'll probably purchase it once it releases on blu ray as I did rather enjoy it (seriously my mouth hurts from smiling and laughing) there are some touching moments where Robbie really shines I just wish there were a little more because as everyone I absolutely adore Margot and her films.Anyway Barbie is a blast. It's a definite recommend on my list.",now i becom barbi girl enjoy barbi world,i wait releas long i final got watch today i absolut love it fun margot robbi extra stuff tarantino know i mean and absolut banger what could want new summer classichonestli depth stori aint expect film barbi lol ill probabl go back watch tbh ill probabl purchas releas blu ray i rather enjoy serious mouth hurt smile laugh touch moment robbi realli shine i wish littl everyon i absolut ador margot filmsanyway barbi blast it definit recommend list
Good...not great,"""Barbie"" is a movie that is setting all sorts of records, so it's obvious that the film is touching many people. For some, it's the fun of seeing a doll come to life, for others it's the theme of empowerment that make the movie a big hit. As for me, I did like it and thought it was a pretty good movie...but it's not for everyone.The first 2/3 of the film are simply fun and a visual delight. Seeing all the Barbie's in Barbieland was a joy. It also was very nice seeing Barbie enter the real world and interact with all the unfamiliar aspects of it. As for the final third, for me, this is what hurt the film a bit...at least for some viewers. Why? Well, I loved its message of female empowerment but I also felt it was delivered like a sledgehammer. Instead of talking about it and getting on with the plot, the movie bogged down for me and seemed to keep making the same point repeatedly. Subtle, it was not. On the other hand, who am I to complain...I did like the movie and am glad it had a nice feminist bent. Obviously this worked for many women seeing the film. Overall, a very good movie that slowed to a crawl towards the end. Not bad...but a film I wanted to like more than I actually did.",goodnot great,barbi movi set sort record obviou film touch mani peopl for fun see doll come life other theme empower make movi big hit a i like thought pretti good moviebut everyoneth first film simpli fun visual delight see barbi barbieland joy it also nice see barbi enter real world interact unfamiliar aspect a final third hurt film bitat least viewer whi well i love messag femal empower i also felt deliv like sledgehamm instead talk get plot movi bog seem keep make point repeatedli subtl on hand i complaini like movi glad nice feminist bent obvious work mani woman see film overal good movi slow crawl toward end not badbut film i want like i actual
A triumph of marketing for a poorly realised story,"It's weird seeing a movie that puts gay male culture front and centre of a lesbian-free world.This highlights the movie's sloppy construction, it doesn't know what it wants to be.The movie starts with a homage to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey resulting in every child rejecting baby dolls. What started out as amusing is so committed to a shot-for-shot homage it becomes a sinister, disturbing message that closely matches 2001's statement of the human race discovering weapons.A chase scene in an office makes no sense.A key character at her kitchen table is a touching moment but the way she is found has no internal logic.Having seen this film with various friends I noticed audiences were left cold at same points.Why would Ken run into plastic moulded waves in an environment he lives in?

I don't see how it was preachy,"In this day and age with society overall becoming more and more polarized and our leaders around the world doing nothing to improve dialogue, it seems that people became broken records. Now everything in the movies and TV shows is perceived as preachy, not everything is a conspiracy, people need to consider that movies and TV shows at its core, and specially the good ones, are about sharing perspectives and allow the audience, if their minds are opened to it, to acknowledge all sides of the stories.So let's start with the actual review, Greta Gerwig seems to have found an actual legitimate story for the type of message she delivered, contrary to most criticism I didn't find the movie preachy or biased at all, I actually felt it was incredibly balanced and the message made sense considering the plot. Sometimes I do agree that these (for some reason) delicate social topics tend to be pushed into films because a lot of studio directors want to align with trends to make a few more dollars, but in this particular film I didn't felt that at all!It's a fictional story that has the ability to tell a bit of historical context of one of the most (if not the most) famous dolls in the world and how it impacted the world culture and how it actually affected women's image with its controversial decisions.The other aspect of this fictional story is providing perspective, of how women are perceived and treated in our society, the rooted systemic issues we tend to ignore AND with the Barbie plot device provide some fun and interesting analogy of how society would be if it was the other way around and women were the ones holding most power.But again there's no hidden dark meaning, it's just a woman's perspective and if you think about it, even though reality change a lot considering the country where you live, it's not that ridiculous, the story is ultimately about equality and its a fun innocent approach to it.Margot Robbie is insanely talented and its amazing to watch her portray this role, for once I am hoping that we keep the dialogue opened and stop inventing false theories .",i dont see preachi,in day age societi overal becom polar leader around world noth improv dialogu seem peopl becam broken record now everyth movi tv show perceiv preachi everyth conspiraci peopl need consid movi tv show core special good one share perspect allow audienc mind open acknowledg side storiesso let start actual review greta gerwig seem found actual legitim stori type messag deliv contrari critic i didnt find movi preachi bias i actual felt incred balanc messag made sen consid plot sometim i agre reason delic social topic tend push film lot studio director want align trend make dollar particular film i didnt felt allit fiction stori abil tell bit histor context one famou doll world impact world cultur actual affect woman imag controversi decisionsth aspect fiction stori provid perspect woman perceiv treat societi root system issu tend ignor and barbi plot devic provid fun interest analog societi would way around woman one hold powerbut there hidden dark mean woman perspect think even though realiti chang lot consid countri live ridicul stori ultim equal fun innoc approach itmargot robbi insan talent amaz watch portray role i hope keep dialogu open stop invent fals theori
No Direction,"The movie was very funny and really enjoyable to laugh at with the full theatre. However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.",no direct,the movi funni realli enjoy laugh full theatr howev messag movi problem i never realli sure i suppos take away noth find equal love everi man cat fall everi woman woman cant anyth it realli silli accur reflect america singl point except barbi get call fascist reason year old i enjoy call woman hate woman realli tri preach empower abil anyth time much resent end movi reinstat hate the major movi hate men much possibl that whatev realli matter stori well fell short mark realli disappoint the pace horribl villain pretti irrelev long run stori place total kid i think worst part disappoint i opportun realli make someth special wasnt point laugh fun i i would expect appropri rate

Didn't hit my pink spot,"My Review - Barbie
In Cinemas now
My Rating 6.5/10I've been keenly looking forward to seeing this much publicised movie because I'm a great fan of Margo Robbie, Ryan Gosling and Greta Gerwig's work.I held the opinion from first hearing about it that it was either going to be brilliant and I'd love it or a huge disappointment and I'd loathe it in other words no in between for me.How ever that's not the case I didn't love it and I didn't loathe it I have to accept that I
just didn't get it ?Perhaps it's because that I'm a 70 plus baby boomer male who felt that the strong feminist message directed towards the predominantly heterosexual male patriarchy for me was just preaching to the converted .Barbie is a comedy fantasy which certainly packs a not so subtle feminist smack in the face of the men who devalue the equality and contribution that women play in our society but they won't see Barbie.The audience on this special preview was young mainly women and they seemed to get the jokes that I didn't and seemed to react very well to the movie applauding at the conclusion.No spoilers about the plot you should judge it yourself as the story is not as simple as the trailer portrays it to be. Barbie and Ken leave the other Barbies and Ken's behind in Barbieland to venture through a portal caused by a stereotypical Barbie played to perfection by Margo Robbie . Barbie is experiencing disturbing emotions that she has to explore further in the real world of humans to understand in an effort to retain her eternal optimism.Ken her buff nerdy and needy boyfriend played by Ryan Gosling joins Barbie on her quest to travel through the portal landing at Venice Beach California complete with roller skates only to discover that the values and gender roles of Barbie land are reversed in the real world . The question for both the surprised dolls is which world do they want to live in?Pink cloud sunny Barbie land where every day is the same and perfect or the human world of Corporate greed and misogyny where you grow old and die?Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling both are impressive and their comedy timing adds a light touch to the darker undertone of the film.Barbie for me has some entertaining moments but they were melting moments for me and while I hope it's popular for the creators of the movie I'm left puzzled at what audience it's aimed at ?The male population that Greta Gerwig cleverly parodies through Ken and his Ken buddies certainly wouldn't see her movie and I think the Disney generation of under 15 would be bored .I did enjoy the technical aspects of Barbie and the incredible amount of research and effort that has gone into producing this very expensive would be box office blockbuster.I also enjoyed homage to great movies of the past like Stanley Kubric's 2001 A Space Odysee , Saturday Night Fever, and of course The Wizard of Oz .It's one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and has been in the pipeline for over a decade and in 2018 after little action was passed into the hands of Warner Bros then in 2019 they finally announced Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig as the lead actor-director duo for this film.Director Greta Gerwig co wrote the screenplay with her partner with Noah Baumbach basing their story on the famous Barbie fashion dolls by Mattel . It is the first live action Barbie film so a lot of creative reputations are dependent on its success .Mattel, the toy company that created Barbie obviously approved of the movie getting screen credit and representation in Greta Gerwig's clever perhaps to clever script.Mattel contributed input towards the set design of the film keeping the old-school charm of the Barbie world intact and I suspect there will be a surge in sales as all the famous Barbie dolls get a mention in this film.Noah Baumbach is Executive Producer as well as his partner Greta Gerwig and Margo Robbie the movies effervescent star are all producers on this project that has an estimated production budget of $145 million US$.Margo Robbie has been quoted as saying ""that the film's aim is to subvert expectations and give audiences ""the thing you didn't know you wanted.I'm not so sure about that statement as Barbie didn't reach my expectations and I felt the thing I didn't know I wanted wasn't what I wanted at all.Top marks to Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto who created a unique color palette for the film that Greta Gerwig named ""Techni-Barbie,"" after the Technicolor format. Also top marks to two time Academy Award Winner designer Jacqueline Durran. It's a given that costumes would be one of the most important factors about the movie,",didnt hit pink spot,my review barbi in cinema my rate ive keenli look forward see much publicis movi im great fan margo robbi ryan gosl greta gerwig worki held opinion first hear either go brilliant id love huge disappoint id loath word mehow ever that case i didnt love i didnt loath i accept i didnt get perhap im plu babi boomer male felt strong feminist messag direct toward predominantli heterosexu male patriarchi preach convert barbi comedi fantasi certainli pack subtl feminist smack face men devalu equal contribut woman play societi wont see barbieth audienc special preview young mainli woman seem get joke i didnt seem react well movi applaud conclusionno spoiler plot judg stori simpl trailer portray barbi ken leav barbi ken behind barbieland ventur portal caus stereotyp barbi play perfect margo robbi barbi experienc disturb emot explor real world human understand effort retain etern optimismken buff nerdi needi boyfriend play ryan gosl join barbi quest travel portal land venic beach california complet roller skate discov valu gender role barbi land revers real world the question surpris doll world want live inpink cloud sunni barbi land everi day perfect human world corpor greed misogyni grow old diemargo robbi ryan gosl impress comedi time add light touch darker underton filmbarbi entertain moment melt moment i hope popular creator movi im left puzzl audienc aim the male popul greta gerwig cleverli parodi ken ken buddi certainli wouldnt see movi i think disney gener would bore i enjoy technic aspect barbi incred amount research effort gone produc expens would box offic blockbusteri also enjoy homag great movi past like stanley kubric a space odyse saturday night fever cours the wizard oz it one anticip movi pipelin decad littl action pas hand warner bro final announc margot robbi greta gerwig lead actordirector duo filmdirector greta gerwig co wrote screenplay partner noah baumbach base stori famou barbi fashion doll mattel it first live action barbi film lot creativ reput depend success mattel toy compani creat barbi obvious approv movi get screen credit represent greta gerwig clever perhap clever scriptmattel contribut input toward set design film keep oldschool charm barbi world intact i suspect surg sale famou barbi doll get mention filmnoah baumbach execut produc well partner greta gerwig margo robbi movi effervesc star produc project estim product budget million usmargo robbi quot say film aim subvert expect give audienc thing didnt know wantedim sure statement barbi didnt reach expect i felt thing i didnt know i want wasnt i want alltop mark cinematograph rodrigo prieto creat uniqu color palett film greta gerwig name technibarbi technicolor format also top mark two time academi award winner design jacquelin durran it given costum would one import factor movi
I am Kenough,"So I went into the movie with little to no expectations and I was pleasantly impressed with the movie overall.So basically the movie is about Barbie who is starting to feel emotions and not everything feels perfect in Barbieland. She ventures to the real world to discover the solution of getting everything perfect again. Barbie is joined by the one and not only KEN, Ken is obsessed with Barbie and sees her as the centre of his world, he goes to the real world and discovers patriarchy, which leads to many events.The movie overall is actually quite funny, Ryan Gosling is fantastic as Ken and the stand out for me, he needs to be many versions of Ken and he kills then all !! Margott is also great, she brings a range to Barbie, for me also Weird Barbie was great, she was funny and brought a difference.There were times I felt the ""woman power"" thing was just a bit much and took me out of the movie, I feel like the movie had that message and didn't need to shove it down your throat but it decided to at points so for me that does bring it down a notch, the daughter was also just annoying hahaha yes I get it she hated the world bla bla, she just had no redeeming qualities, otherwise no complains and I do think it's worth seeing, solid 8/10.",i kenough,so i went movi littl expect i pleasantli impress movi overallso basic movi barbi start feel emot everyth feel perfect barbieland she ventur real world discov solut get everyth perfect barbi join one ken ken ob barbi see centr world goe real world discov patriarchi lead mani eventsth movi overal actual quit funni ryan gosl fantast ken stand need mani version ken kill margott also great bring rang barbi also weird barbi great funni brought differencether time i felt woman power thing bit much took movi i feel like movi messag didnt need shove throat decid point bring notch daughter also annoy hahaha ye i get hate world bla bla redeem qualiti otherwis complain i think worth see solid
Misleading.,"I personally expected the movie to be fun and adventurous. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that what it is supposed to be? It's literally a movie about Barbie. Instead, it felt more like an agent of woke culture, and basically Mattel's (the company that produces Barbie dolls) way of capitalizing the emotional aspect of the cinephiles to make their business more popular and trendier. It continuously tried to portray the fact that Mattel is no more producing white barbie dolls, it is now producing dolls of all colors and races. Well, that is definitely a good thing, but making most of the movie focus on that aspect felt very boring and wrong. If they didn't quite make a movie that is fun and adventurous, why make the marketing events misleading? They could've just focused on the audience for whom it was made, rather than on the entire world through their absurdly irrelevant marketing events that made the world think that this movie is going to be all about fun and adventure. Sadly, it was not nearly as enjoyable as the misleading marketing made it seem.",mislead,i person expect movi fun adventur correct im wrong isnt suppos it liter movi barbi instead felt like agent woke cultur basic mattel compani produc barbi doll way capit emot aspect cinephil make busi popular trendier it continu tri portray fact mattel produc white barbi doll produc doll color race well definit good thing make movi focu aspect felt bore wrong if didnt quit make movi fun adventur make market event mislead they couldv focus audienc made rather entir world absurdli irrelev market event made world think movi go fun adventur sadli nearli enjoy mislead market made seem
Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling's performances bolster a film with messaging that is heavy-handed and bordering on exhaustingly preachy most of the time,"The film opens strongly with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling delivering compelling performances. Their star power and acting prowess add depth to the movie. However, as the film progresses and Barbie encounters her human counterparts in the real world, the thin plot becomes more noticeable. Some viewers might have preferred a subtler approach to delivering the political message, as the film can be seen as overly direct, leading to a polarizing and preachy tone. This approach aligns with the directorial style and screenplay motifs commonly associated with Greta Gerwig.The production design of Barbie Land is visually captivating, offering a feast for the eyes. The music soundtrack, featuring a standout disco track by Dua Lipa, complements the film well. Dua Lipa's cameo as Mermaid Barbie is a highlight.The film incorporates satire and self-aware humor, which adds depth to the story. However, the humor doesn't consistently land, and some moments feel forced. The character Stereotypical Ken provides sporadic moments of humor.In summary, 'Barbie' is a film worth watching at least once. It includes an empowerment monologue delivered by America Ferrera's character, addressing societal expectations placed on women. While there is still some double standard in gender role expectations, it is less prominent in today's society compared to the past. Anyway, an overhyped film from 2023 that I wouldn't watch again.",margot robbi ryan gosl perform bolster film messag heavyhand border exhaustingli preachi time,the film open strongli margot robbi ryan gosl deliv compel perform their star power act prowess add depth movi howev film progress barbi encount human counterpart real world thin plot becom notic some viewer might prefer subtler approach deliv polit messag film seen overli direct lead polar preachi tone thi approach align directori style screenplay motif commonli associ greta gerwigth product design barbi land visual captiv offer feast eye the music soundtrack featur standout disco track dua lipa complement film well dua lipa cameo mermaid barbi highlightth film incorpor satir selfawar humor add depth stori howev humor doesnt consist land moment feel forc the charact stereotyp ken provid sporad moment humorin summari barbi film worth watch least it includ empower monologu deliv america ferrera charact address societ expect place woman while still doubl standard gender role expect le promin today societi compar past anyway overhyp film i wouldnt watch

Excellent marketing team.,"They really did some fantastic marketing with this movie.It's not exactly bad. It's just mediocre. It's very pretty to look at, and some of the music is actually quite funny and fitting.But this is nowhere near what was advertised, it's not a fun jokey movie that brought homage to old movies, some saterical jokes etc. It's that, followed by story with heaaaavy messaging, followed again by a quick joke.However none of it is funny or interesting enough to justify its runtime.

"Some humorous moments, but the story fell flat","Barbie, a movie about the beloved doll and all her identities and her friends, what could go wrong? A lot apparently. It started with voice over narration and went downhill from there. There was too much telling rather than showing. Most of this movie constantly explained everything and often told me how I should feel about it. The writing felt like it was trying too hard to be profound and tried to oversimplify complex subjects and gender roles. There were some funny moments, but a lot of the humor and story were far from subtle. I never felt drawn into the characters and what they were experiencing. The story lacked stakes. I didn't care about Barbie or Ken. In the right hands, this movie could have been fun. But Barbie didn't seem to know what it wanted to be or what story it wanted to tell.",some humor moment stori fell flat,barbi movi belov doll ident friend could go wrong a lot appar it start voic narrat went downhil there much tell rather show most movi constantli explain everyth often told i feel the write felt like tri hard profound tri oversimplifi complex subject gender role there funni moment lot humor stori far subtl i never felt drawn charact experienc the stori lack stake i didnt care barbi ken in right hand movi could fun but barbi didnt seem know want stori want tell
A lot of fun....,"Firstly, let's just say that I am not in the ideal demographic for 'Barbie', being male, 66 years old, and I don't have children, so it's taken me a while to get to this film. Anyway, what a lot of fun this film is. The concept works brilliantly and it's all carried through with self effacing charm and humour that both wins you over from the start , opening wonderfully with a parody of 2001, and then keeps you engaged throughout. Margot Robbie is perfect in the lead and Ryan Gossling couldn't be better as Ken (or one of the many Ken's), and the whole thing chugs along effortlessly and humorously. The idea of the conflict between the wonderfully created female world of Barbieland and the male dominated real world is milked for all it can give, with director Greta Gerwig hardly missing a trick. On so many levels this is a clever and tremendously entertaining film and I really loved it - even an old guy like me....",a lot fun,firstli let say i ideal demograph barbi male year old i dont child taken get film anyway lot fun film the concept work brilliantli carri self effac charm humour win start open wonder parodi keep engag throughout margot robbi perfect lead ryan gossl couldnt better ken one mani ken whole thing chug along effortlessli humor the idea conflict wonder creat femal world barbieland male domin real world milk give director greta gerwig hardli miss trick on mani level clever tremend entertain film i realli love even old guy like
Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary.

Seriously, and I love it for that!","I mean, Margo Robbie as Barbie just made perfect sense, but I really wanted to see the movie when I herd that Ryian Gosling was going to be Ken, I just thought that would be hilarious and I was right!I was a little bit nervous when I heard this was not going to be an in-universe thing and that Barbie would enter the real world, but that was a great story.The real-life story did give the art direction the purpose of making a ""BarbieLand"" with life size dream houses even I wanted to live in.

Kenough,"Movies are odd sometimes. In this case, I feel like the review I would have written the second the credits rolled would've been more positive than the one I'm watching now, a couple of hours later. But, as I've had time to sit with this one, I can't help but feel my opinion on it... Diminishing.Let's start on the positive though. This movie is fun. A lot of fun. It's funny, clever and it's trying to get a message across. The actors are all doing a fine job and while I might not have personally thought them to be perfectly cast, that doesn't take away from the fine job that they all did.Beyond the superficial though, I think this movie starts to suffer the more and more I dig into it. I think the pacing is just a bit off. It's either going too slow or too fast, most of the time, not necessarily to a tremendous degree, but certainly a noticeable one. Then there's the whole message of the movie, which is certainly important but is something that feels like it just came too late. I don't know that we need this particular take on sex and gender roles right now. Again, not because it's not relevant, but because other things have beat this to the finish line and frankly, done it better. This is like swinging through a McDonalds to get a Barbie pink strawberry shake after having had a delicious meal already. Sure it's fun, but it's largely pointless. It's the fluff following the real deal. That's not exactly a dealbreaker, but for a film that spends so much of its time and energy on certain things, it definitely felt diminished by the fact that its really just retreading ground already walked, albeit in a shinier package. Between that and the runaway hype train on this, all the controversy and coverage it's gotten, it's hard to not walk away from this and feeling a bit disappointed.Again, fun movie. Enjoyable movie for the most part even. It feels very much like something with superficial popularity though. Yes, it's being talked about, it's in the conversation and people are paying attention to it now but I have a very hard time imagining this having the same kind of lasting impact as other films might. And maybe that's not what it's trying to do, maybe I'm prescribing too much meaning to it, that could very well be true. But, for a movie so focused on certain things, it's hard not to draw those conclusions.",kenough,movi odd sometim in case i feel like review i would written second credit roll wouldv posit one im watch coupl hour later but ive time sit one i cant help feel opinion diminishinglet start posit though thi movi fun a lot fun it funni clever tri get messag across the actor fine job i might person thought perfectli cast doesnt take away fine job didbeyond superfici though i think movi start suffer i dig i think pace bit it either go slow fast time necessarili tremend degre certainli notic one then there whole messag movi certainli import someth feel like came late i dont know need particular take sex gender role right again relev thing beat finish line frankli done better thi like swing mcdonald get barbi pink strawberri shake delici meal alreadi sure fun larg pointless it fluff follow real deal that exactli dealbreak film spend much time energi certain thing definit felt diminish fact realli retread ground alreadi walk albeit shinier packag between runaway hype train controversi coverag gotten hard walk away feel bit disappointedagain fun movi enjoy movi part even it feel much like someth superfici popular though ye talk convers peopl pay attent i hard time imagin kind last impact film might and mayb that tri mayb im prescrib much mean could well true but movi focus certain thing hard draw conclus
A sheer pleasure to watch.,"Barbie (2023) -*I wrote this review about three times and I'm afraid it's still a bit of a ramble.I didn't go in to watching this expecting it to amaze me, but to only provide a few basic giggles. I suppose I'd thought that it would be too juvenile and aimed at teens and tweens, but actually it was very good and the more I recalled of it, the more I wanted to see it again.There was so much nostalgia throughout this film, even for me as a gay man, who as a child learned that he needed to catch his sister in a good mood if he wanted to play Barbie with her and ultimately ended up playing with his 'Star Wars' figures a lot instead.The little touches and the interesting special editions of the doll that popped up throughout were cleverly used and some of them easy to remember from trips to the toy shop and the times that I used to sneak in to my sisters room to play with her collection whilst she was out.Add to that a great deal of humour in various styles and it would be hard for even the most masculine, anti-feminist not to find something to laugh at in this film, despite the fact that it took the mick out of men in general.Yes it did make a point of empowering women of all backgrounds, which it was always going to do, but I felt that it did it without making such a harsh attack on men that the average male would feel threatened by it or take the jokes with anything but a pinch of salt and there is always the hope that some people would learn from it.Essentially it was just parodying the way that women have been treated over the years and showing that treatment up for the stupid behaviour that it was and sadly still is by exploring how a matriarchy might effect men and the ways that they might react.The general production of the film came across like a cross between 'Elf' (2003), 'The Lego Movie' (2014), 'Big' (1988) and so many others of that oeuvre.All of it, but specifically Barbieland was brilliantly designed and constructed, colourful and fun, with a great soundtrack and some real laugh out loud moments, a lot of which were quite adult. And while the majority of those jokes might go over the heads of a younger audience, I could see why it was given a 12 rating. The adventure had an emotional depth that might not grip younger kids.With regards to the cast, Margot Robbie was great in her role of stereotypical Barbie. I loved the scene where ""Ugly Betty"" (America Ferrera as Gloria) was applying Margot's make up as it seemed so ironic, but I'm afraid that Barb's leading man Ken really stole the limelight, especially with his song ""I'm Just Ken"", which has featured very heavily on my iTunes lately.Ryan Gosling was superb as the plasticised blonde and blue eyed man, although at times I wasn't sure whether his toned abs might not actually be a plastic prosthetic, because they weren't totally natural looking.However, I think that I've found a new appreciation for Ryan after the disaster that was 'La La Land' (2016), because he was just so good in this role. It was another irony that he stood out so much in a film about Barbie, which repeatedly referred to Ken as just an accessory.I also loved Rhea Perlman in her casting. The usually brassy little lady seemed perfect in her role and I thought that she could have performed Helen Mirren's Narrator part as well, because, for the amount Helen actually said, it didn't really need another celebrity and Rhea's character would have leant itself to the voiceover easily.""Weird"" Barbie, the doll who was played with too much, performed by Kate McKinnon was fantastic and an absolutely great addition to the story.I also liked Michael Cera's character Allan, it wasn't anything very new for him, but delivered a different kind of comic relief with his subtlety and non presence.I did however feel that Will Ferrell had some typical Ferrell moments that were a bit daft and could have been left out, but in the end even he was appropriate in his part of the ditsy Mattel CEO as well.There really was an amalgamation of comedic stylings, which I felt would make it appealing to almost anyone.I'm not sure that I caught all of the cameos dotted throughout, but there were some definite surprises and I looked forward to trying to spot them all when I saw it again.I did notice that there was a lot of British actors among the cast though. At least three of them were from the TV series 'Sex Education' (2019-23).Not that I'm saying that all those Brits were a bad thing, but it was odd that they were mostly playing Americans. I would assume that a lot of it was filmed in the UK, making it easier to use them.Ultimately I enjoyed the inclusion of all of the British cast, 3 of whom that I've had the pleasure to work with myself.I specifically liked Connor Swindells as Aaron Dinkins. After his roles in 'Sex Education' and 'SAS: Rogue Heroes' (2022-) I felt that this was yet another example of his diversity.And on the topic of diversity, I really appreciated that people from all walks of life were represented in the film, but not made a fuss of or shoved in my face to prove a point that the film and Barbieland was an educated place. I spotted the Wheelchair Barbie amongst the rest, but they didn't include her in the story just to tick a box and I was glad of that, because I'm tired of films trying too hard to be politically correct and compromising the end result to achieve it. That doesn't mean that I wouldn't have been happy to see her play a key role if it had been relevant to the story of course.On my second viewing of this one I felt that there was also a more subtle message about not taking people for granted and another about the fact that you can't stop things from changing. I think it was those ideas that mellowed out the overall strong female empowerment and equal rights message that rightly seemed to be the primary element of the film, because you couldn't help but feel for Ken, whilst also empathising with Barbie.I also remembered that I had thought the end montage to be somewhat lacking in power and I think that was due to the clarity and rush of the images that went by. I would have liked it to have been a bit brighter and certainly visually clearer.As a whole though it was a real pleasure to watch and left me with a smile on my face. I'm pretty sure that I will end up with it on DVD, because it was one of those films that will always make me feel a joy to watch, which I believe the world needs more of.838.49/1000.",a sheer pleasur watch,barbi i wrote review three time im afraid still bit ramblei didnt go watch expect amaz provid basic giggl i suppos id thought would juvenil aim teen tween actual good i recal i want see againther much nostalgia throughout film even gay man child learn need catch sister good mood want play barbi ultim end play star war figur lot insteadth littl touch interest special edit doll pop throughout cleverli use easi rememb trip toy shop time i use sneak sister room play collect whilst outadd great deal humour variou style would hard even masculin antifeminist find someth laugh film despit fact took mick men generaly make point empow woman background alway go i felt without make harsh attack men averag male would feel threaten take joke anyth pinch salt alway hope peopl would learn itessenti parodi way woman treat year show treatment stupid behaviour sadli still explor matriarchi might effect men way might reactth gener product film came across like cross elf the lego movi big mani other oeuvreal specif barbieland brilliantli design construct colour fun great soundtrack real laugh loud moment lot quit adult and major joke might go head younger audienc i could see given rate the adventur emot depth might grip younger kidswith regard cast margot robbi great role stereotyp barbi i love scene ugli betti america ferrera gloria appli margot make seem iron im afraid barb lead man ken realli stole limelight especi song im just ken featur heavili itun latelyryan gosl superb plasticis blond blue eye man although time i wasnt sure whether tone ab might actual plastic prosthet werent total natur lookinghowev i think ive found new appreci ryan disast la la land good role it anoth ironi stood much film barbi repeatedli refer ken accessoryi also love rhea perlman cast the usual brassi littl ladi seem perfect role i thought could perform helen mirren narrat part well amount helen actual said didnt realli need anoth celebr rhea charact would leant voiceov easilyweird barbi doll play much perform kate mckinnon fantast absolut great addit storyi also like michael cera charact allan wasnt anyth new deliv differ kind comic relief subtleti non presencei howev feel will ferrel typic ferrel moment bit daft could left end even appropri part ditsi mattel ceo wellther realli amalgam comed style i felt would make appeal almost anyoneim sure i caught cameo dot throughout definit surpris i look forward tri spot i saw againi notic lot british actor among cast though at least three tv seri sex educ not im say brit bad thing odd mostli play american i would assum lot film uk make easier use themultim i enjoy inclus british cast ive pleasur work myselfi specif like connor swindel aaron dinkin after role sex educ sa rogu hero i felt yet anoth exampl diversityand topic diver i realli appreci peopl walk life repres film made fuss shove face prove point film barbieland educ place i spot wheelchair barbi amongst rest didnt includ stori tick box i glad im tire film tri hard polit correct compromis end result achiev that doesnt mean i wouldnt happi see play key role relev stori courseon second view one i felt also subtl messag take peopl grant anoth fact cant stop thing chang i think idea mellow overal strong femal empower equal right messag rightli seem primari element film couldnt help feel ken whilst also empathis barbiei also rememb i thought end montag somewhat lack power i think due clariti rush imag went i would like bit brighter certainli visual clearera whole though real pleasur watch left smile face im pretti sure i end dvd one film alway make feel joy watch i believ world need
Barbie,"This probably has been the biggest film of 2023.It was also the most shocking film of 2023 because really people didn't know what to expect.This certainly isn't the Barbie film I expected. It's not aimed at little girls, it takes massive swings at popular culture and society, and actually has a real sense of heart.Because of all these things you'll either love it or hate it. There's nobody really in the middle on this film, the reaction is so wide spread.I thought it was fine, I thought it was a nice broad comedy that we don't always have these days. Both the two leads were great, and there are lots of lovely moments.It is preachy, it does hit you over the head with its messages, but on the whole it remains bright and colourful.",barbi,thi probabl biggest film it also shock film realli peopl didnt know expectthi certainli isnt barbi film i expect it aim littl girl take massiv swing popular cultur societi actual real sen heartbecaus thing youll either love hate there nobodi realli middl film reaction wide spreadi thought fine i thought nice broad comedi dont alway day both two lead great lot love momentsit preachi hit head messag whole remain bright colour
This movie tries to be too much,"I wanted to like it. But I just didn't. The story wasn't very compelling to me because it seemed as if the entire point of much of the movie was to provide learning moments for viewers with some slapstick comedy and quick-delivery comedy. The story itself should nearly always be more important.All of the goofiness largely would have been excused to me if the comedic moments were really funny. And the way this film was hyped made me think it was going to be super funny. But I rarely laughed. And that's even more of a shame given the talent assembled for the cast. There also weren't many surprising reveals to the audience when maybe there could have been if things were presented differently.I also found it annoying to see Will Farrell play a similar part to what he played in the Lego Movie. Sure he's a CEO rather than a dad. But he was filling the same evil disciplinarian adult role for a movie about a kid's toy. It just felt lazy to not cast someone else for that part, and just made me wish the movie was able to provide the humor and intrigue that the first Lego movie provided to its audience.I'd rather this film felt like a comedy or dramatic experience which has some relevant takes on feminism and culture than thinly veiled sermon with occasional jokes that land amongst a ton that didn't land.I also felt like the movie had way too many characters and ideas thrown together. There was Barbie, Ken, many other Barbies, many other Kens, the crazy Barbie, the CEOs, the mother, the teen, the narrator and more. And it's not just that they had all of these characters. They also tried to have some learning moments delivered-by or delivered-to a majority of these characters. I felt like they would have been better off trying to deliver all these lessons over 3-5 movies rather than 1. And obviously you don't want it ever to seem like the lessons are being delivered but experiences through the story and the consequences of the actions and stakes created by the characters' decisions. Instead there didn't seem like any stakes because the Barbies didn't seem to fit in the real world and the real people didn't fit in the Barbie world.Honestly my favorite part of the movie was a lot of the Easter egg stuff about odd Barbie products over the years. And Easter eggs shouldn't be the best part of any movie. They should be a bonus to the overall experience of the story.",thi movi tri much,i want like but i didnt the stori wasnt compel seem entir point much movi provid learn moment viewer slapstick comedi quickdeliveri comedi the stori nearli alway importantal goofi larg would excus comed moment realli funni and way film hype made think go super funni but i rare laugh and that even shame given talent assembl cast there also werent mani surpris reveal audienc mayb could thing present differentlyi also found annoy see will farrel play similar part play lego movi sure he ceo rather dad but fill evil disciplinarian adult role movi kid toy it felt lazi cast someon el part made wish movi abl provid humor intrigu first lego movi provid audienceid rather film felt like comedi dramat experi relev take femin cultur thinli veil sermon occasion joke land amongst ton didnt landi also felt like movi way mani charact idea thrown togeth there barbi ken mani barbi mani ken crazi barbi ceo mother teen narrat and charact they also tri learn moment deliveredbi deliveredto major charact i felt like would better tri deliv lesson movi rather and obvious dont want ever seem like lesson deliv experi stori consequ action stake creat charact decis instead didnt seem like stake barbi didnt seem fit real world real peopl didnt fit barbi worldhonestli favorit part movi lot easter egg stuff odd barbi product year and easter egg shouldnt best part movi they bonu overal experi stori
Surprisingly good,"I think part of my brain rejects this for being a feature-length toy commercial, but it's a very small part of my brain (and that really wasn't where my mind was for the majority of the movie).Overall, it's probably about as good as an official live-action Barbie movie could ever be, with Greta Gerwig clearly given plenty of freedom to have fun with a property/movie like this. It's bigger in scale than her previous two films (Ladybird and Little Women, both of which I prefer to this by a little), and the scale and creativity of the film really kept the momentum going. It's very funny in parts, and though I guess it's sort of a kid-friendly movie, there are tons of jokes and references that'll go over the heads of younger kids. ""What's a fascist?"" is something I heard a four-year-old ask one of their parents halfway through the movie, and that in itself was kind of funny to hear.Margot Robbie is good as always, and is given a surprising amount to do emotionally. It is Barbie's movie, but Ryan Gosling's Ken often steals the film whenever he's on-screen (as the film's wrapping up, there's a fairly awkward pivot to ""oh yeah, this is Barbie's movie;"" it's even addressed in dialogue). I don't think that's a problem, because he's hilarious - it might be one of the best performances he's ever given. I also don't think his character is used ""just"" to attack men, the way I imagine some people will read into it. Barbie does the most learning and has the biggest character arc, sure, but Ken goes through one too, and I thought they wrapped up that side of things nicely.It's an enjoyable movie that deals with some hefty topics (namedropping plenty of words younger kids won't have even heard before) in a mostly consistent way. Some tonal shifts are jarring, and while the vast majority of jokes land, I don't think all did. It does also feel a bit too directly like a commercial at a couple of points, especially early on, but I did expect that. And it's a testament to the quality of the movie that me and all my anti-consumerist thoughts didn't overpower my mind throughout most of this.",surprisingli good,i think part brain reject featurelength toy commerci small part brain realli wasnt mind major movieoveral probabl good offici liveact barbi movi could ever greta gerwig clearli given plenti freedom fun propertymovi like it bigger scale previou two film ladybird littl woman i prefer littl scale creativ film realli kept momentum go it funni part though i guess sort kidfriendli movi ton joke refer thatll go head younger kid what fascist someth i heard fouryearold ask one parent halfway movi kind funni hearmargot robbi good alway given surpris amount emot it barbi movi ryan gosl ken often steal film whenev he onscreen film wrap there fairli awkward pivot oh yeah barbi movi even address dialogu i dont think that problem he hilari might one best perform he ever given i also dont think charact use attack men way i imagin peopl read barbi learn biggest charact arc sure ken goe one i thought wrap side thing nicelyit enjoy movi deal hefti topic namedrop plenti word younger kid wont even heard mostli consist way some tonal shift jar vast major joke land i dont think it also feel bit directli like commerci coupl point especi earli i expect and testament qualiti movi anticonsumerist thought didnt overpow mind throughout
serious Barbie,"BARBIE (2023)
Greetings again from the darkness. A reasonable assumption could be made that a movie based on a doll so popular with pre-adolescent girls would be geared towards that audience. However, this is the era of comic book movies targeting ""grown-ups"", and since we know, based on her previous work (the exceptional LADY BIRD, 2017), Greta Gerwig is an intelligent filmmaker, a more reasonable assumption is that she purposefully aimed the movie at women who once played with Barbie dolls and now fill their days with work, family, and adulting. This strategy has proven to be box office gold, and the heavy dose of cosplay at screenings proves the lasting impact this plastic doll has had on many women who lined up for tickets.Ms. Gerwig co-wrote the screenplay with her real-life spouse and fellow filmmaker, Noah Baumbach (MARRIAGE STORY, 2019), and it's fascinating to see what they have produced. Whether you find the film entertaining is another matter altogether, yet we tip our cap to the strange, visually-stimulating, and thought-provoking end result. Many will go in-depth on analyzing the gender politics and feminist approach to the story; however, I'm just here to discuss this as a movie, not a movement.Two-time Oscar nominee Margot Robbie stuns in the opening sequence (a tribute to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY) as the original 1959 Barbie. In fact, Ms. Robbie is terrific throughout in this more-challenging-than-expected role. She's so much more than a pretty face in high heels, as she's previously proven in a risk-taking career featuring memorable turns in such films as THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013), SUICIDE SQUAD (2016), I, TONYA (2017), as Sharon Tate in ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD (2019), and last year's underappreciated BABYLON (2022). This time she portrays 'Stereotypical' Barbie, whose everyday is perfect in Barbieland. It's here where we meet a diverse group of Barbies featuring Issa Rae, Alexandra Shipp, Emma Mackey, Sharon Rooney, Dua Lip, and others. We are also introduced to Ken (two-time Oscar nominee Ryan Gosling, terrific here), whose mood for the day is totally dependent on whether Barbie acknowledges him. An equally diverse group of Kens features Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, John Cena, Ncuti Gatwa, and others.Barbie's paradise is rocked one day when she begins wondering about death. A trip to ""Weird Barbie"" (a kooky Kate McKinnon) lets her know that the only cure for this existential crisis is a visit to the human world, where a sad girl is playing with her doll. It's really an imaginative hook to allow the two worlds to collide. Unfortunately, only bits and pieces of the human world clicked for me (loved the rollerblading at Venice Beach). It makes sense that Barbie is shocked to discover the misogyny and patriarchy ruling the human world, but there are three other elements at play here: Ken discovering that men don't take a backseat to women in this world, and in fact, they dominate; the corporate office of Mattel plays like a slapstick cartoon with Will Ferrell as a nonsensical CEO; and the mother-daughter duo of America Ferrera as Gloria and Ariana Greenblat as Sasha. The big twist occurs in that latter sequence, and it's Ms. Ferrera who dishes out the gut punch soliloquy about what's expected of women and how they are viewed. This monologue is the lesson director Gerwig wants viewers to leave with.Barbie's return to a much-changed Barbieland finds Ken and other Kens treating the Dreamhouse like a Frat house. See, the boys have learned how to run things their way ... and at its core, that's my main issue with the movie's theme. Empowering women is a good thing, but why did Ms. Gerwig feel the need to make everything either a win for the women or a win for the men? I have always thought equality was the goal, not dominance. It's this approach that gives the film a serious and dark undertone in a quite heavy-handed manner. Sure women enjoy having power. So do men. That's no great mystery solved, and in fact makes these obvious points somehow more obvious.Let's talk about a few other less ominous topics. Helen Mirren delivers an admirable voiceover as the narrator, and a depressed Barbie and Ken's affinity for horses are nice touches. Two of my favorite segments are Barbie's first interaction in the human world ... a ""beautiful"" woman on a park bench played by Oscar winner Ann Roth (a renowned Costume Designer who did not handle the costumes for this film), and a conversation with Barbie inventor Ruth Handler (played by Rhea Perlman), who named the doll after her daughter. While I hold firm on my belief that the film is not especially entertaining/fun, I'll also admit the song and dance around the ""I'm Just Ken"" number was a hoot. Other than performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, the star here is the Production Design from six-time Oscar nominee Sarah Greenwood. The film looks amazing, even if you might get your fill of pink by the end. Barbieland is quite a sight - it's a shame the rest of the movie didn't deliver this much fun, and instead pitted men against women.",seriou barbi,barbi greet dark a reason assumpt could made movi base doll popular preadolesc girl would gear toward audienc howev era comic book movi target grownup sinc know base previou work except ladi bird greta gerwig intellig filmmak reason assumpt purpos aim movi woman play barbi doll fill day work famili adult thi strategi proven box offic gold heavi dose cosplay screen prove last impact plastic doll mani woman line ticketsm gerwig cowrot screenplay reallif spous fellow filmmak noah baumbach marriag stori fascin see produc whether find film entertain anoth matter altogeth yet tip cap strang visuallystimul thoughtprovok end result mani go indepth analyz gender polit feminist approach stori howev im discus movi movementtwotim oscar nomine margot robbi stun open sequenc tribut a space odyssey origin barbi in fact m robbi terrif throughout morechallengingthanexpect role she much pretti face high heel she previous proven risktak career featur memor turn film the wolf of wall street suicid squad i tonya sharon tate onc upon a time in hollywood last year underappreci babylon thi time portray stereotyp barbi whose everyday perfect barbieland it meet diver group barbi featur issa rae alexandra shipp emma mackey sharon rooney dua lip other we also introduc ken twotim oscar nomine ryan gosl terrif whose mood day total depend whether barbi acknowledg an equal diver group ken featur simu liu kingsley benadir john cena ncuti gatwa othersbarbi paradis rock one day begin wonder death a trip weird barbi kooki kate mckinnon let know cure existenti crisi visit human world sad girl play doll it realli imagin hook allow two world collid unfortun bit piec human world click love rollerblad venic beach it make sen barbi shock discov misogyni patriarchi rule human world three element play ken discov men dont take backseat woman world fact domin corpor offic mattel play like slapstick cartoon will ferrel nonsens ceo motherdaught duo america ferrera gloria ariana greenblat sasha the big twist occur latter sequenc m ferrera dish gut punch soliloquy what expect woman view thi monologu lesson director gerwig want viewer leav withbarbi return muchchang barbieland find ken ken treat dreamhous like frat hous see boy learn run thing way core that main issu movi theme empow woman good thing m gerwig feel need make everyth either win woman win men i alway thought equal goal domin it approach give film seriou dark underton quit heavyhand manner sure woman enjoy power so men that great mysteri solv fact make obviou point somehow obviouslet talk le omin topic helen mirren deliv admir voiceov narrat depress barbi ken affin hors nice touch two favorit segment barbi first interact human world beauti woman park bench play oscar winner ann roth renown costum design handl costum film convers barbi inventor ruth handler play rhea perlman name doll daughter while i hold firm belief film especi entertainingfun ill also admit song danc around im just ken number hoot other perform margot robbi ryan gosl star product design sixtim oscar nomine sarah greenwood the film look amaz even might get fill pink end barbieland quit sight shame rest movi didnt deliv much fun instead pit men woman
Did I watch the same movie as everyone else lol,"While the production value, cinematography and acting were what you would expect from Margo Robbie and the supporting cast. I felt the movie fell short of not preaching to me and spreading a message of division rather than unity. Men and women cannot survive without each other but you'd never know it watching this movie. And me having my 13 year old daughter with me almost caused me to walk out of the theater. I kept on waiting for the writers to hit the direction of unity but it never came. After the movie my daughter brought up the message to me saying how she even noticed the weird agenda they're trying to push and said that is not a movie for the easily impressionable. Come to find out my daughter is better suited to take on the world that I thought she was. Proud day for me as a father.",did i watch movi everyon el lol,while product valu cinematographi act would expect margo robbi support cast i felt movi fell short preach spread messag divis rather uniti men woman surviv without youd never know watch movi and year old daughter almost caus walk theater i kept wait writer hit direct uniti never came after movi daughter brought messag say even notic weird agenda theyr tri push said movi easili impression come find daughter better suit take world i thought proud day father
What A Film! I Was Ecstatic About Seeing Barbie And It Definitely Exceeded My Expectations By Far.,"What a film! I was ecstatic about seeing Barbie and it definitely exceeded my expectations by far. As much as I was excited, I was a bit scared that the stakes were too high; after all Barbie is an icon and a part of so many people's childhood. For a film like this it's very easy to create something corny, disappointing, or unappealing to viewers. I'm so glad that Gretta Gerwig stepped up to the plate and created an absolute masterpiece.The film starts with showing the origin of Barbie in 1959. It explains how little girls used to play with baby dolls and commonly acted as their mothers, but wanted a doll that they could really play with instead of taking care of. And that's how Barbie came about. Then we see the beautiful Barbie world where every Barbie is a part of something. We see Barbie doctors, Barbie novelists, Barbie astronauts, Barbie everything! And in Barbie's world every day is perfect. The star of the show Margot Robbie plays ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and she starts to notice strange things happening to her. She has to visit the real world to see who was playing with her to discover why these strange things are happening. The rest of the film is about Barbie trying to find herself and discovering scary aspects of the real world that she was blinded by before.There was so much love put into this film and you can really see that on screen. The comedy in this film is so on point that the whole theater was laughing when I went to see this film. Huge kudos to Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, writers of this incredible screenplay. The script is pure genius; I love how the film really honors Barbie and what she was made for. The cast of this film is exceptional. Margot Robbie was originally producing the film until she was cast as Barbie. Margot is the perfect Barbie; she plays this role so well she is like a real-life Barbie on screen. The way she embodies Barbie is just so perfect. I was really excited to see Ryan Gosling as Ken since he's one of my favorite actors. There's a lot of controversy as to why Ryan Gosling was cast as Ken but he makes perfect sense. He plays Ken so well he really nails what it means to be Ken in this film. America Ferrera plays a Mom named Gloria and she is such an interesting character. She plays a mom who's going through struggles of just being a woman and I'm sure her character will speak to so many mothers. It would be a crime to not talk about the insane set. Funny enough, Greta Gerwig used so much pink paint for this set that it actually drained an entire company's supply. The Barbie world is exactly as you'd expect it -- from Barbie dream-houses to Barbie beaches -- everything looks like it came right out of a toy store. Rodrigo Prieto shot this film and the cinematography is extraordinary. As someone who grew up with Barbie, this film really speaks to me. I am in love with the score of this film. Billie Eilish's ""What was I made for"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard. This film is packed with so many great artists like Tame Impalla, Lizzo, Dua Lipa and many others.The film is packed with so many messages. I was surprised with how many topics this film covers -- what it means to be a woman, what it means to be a mother, what it's like to grow up in today's society, what is love, and so much more. This film is a celebration of women and girlhood but I also love how it represents men. Ken is discovering how men are viewed in today's society in a similar way to how Barbie is discovering who she is.I give Barbie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults.

The Ken Stuff Goes on WAY Too Long,"The weirdest thing about Barbie is that Greta Gerwig couldn't even do Barbie without making such a HUGE deference to Ken. I get that she was trying to make a statement about how women feel by using the Ken's as an ""opposite mirror"" to try to get men to understand patriarchy. I do get that. But aren't there multiple speeches about how taking care of men and fixing them isn't women's job?Good lord there was a point where Ryan Gosling's pity-party singing just gets on my nerves and I almost wanted to turn this flick off. I told myself that at some point Barbie would stop being a bad musical and turn back into a funny film with some adult commentary about gender roles in society.",the ken stuff goe way too long,the weirdest thing barbi greta gerwig couldnt even barbi without make huge defer ken i get tri make statement woman feel use ken opposit mirror tri get men understand patriarchi i get but arent multipl speech take care men fix isnt woman jobgood lord point ryan gosl pityparti sing get nerv i almost want turn flick i told point barbi would stop bad music turn back funni film adult commentari gender role societi
Barbie is a beautiful love letter to womanhood.,"Ever since I saw Lady Bird, I knew that I will love Greta and her style. It was so human and it spoke to me. So when Barbie was released, there was no doubt I will like this film-but not this much. In 114 minutes, Greta serves everything that she intended sending a beautiful positive message about womanhood. What it means to be human, what it means to live in this broken patriarchal system. The message is clear: to be human is to feel. This movie is funny. And as someone who is not a fan of American humor, that's a big one. But I laughed through the entire movie. I also shared a tear. I loved America's monologue about womanhood. I loved Dame Helen Mirren as a narrator-great choice. Margot is a star. Her Barbie is so authentic. She portrays comedy, as well as the emotional part of the character so well. That last scene was so good. Now I can't skip the star of the film, and that is Ryan Gossling. Ken was hilarious and I will quote him for the rest of my life. But also shows that Greta is sweet to men offering them compassion by showing them that they are enough as it is, they don't have to be more than that. Greta (and Noah), really made a beautiful love letter to womanhood by showing all the parts of it-please the scene with the old lady had my heart. Overall it's already classic and the movie, that will probably be one of my comfort movies.",barbi beauti love letter womanhood,ever sinc i saw ladi bird i knew i love greta style it human spoke so barbi releas doubt i like filmbut much in minut greta serv everyth intend send beauti posit messag womanhood what mean human mean live broken patriarch system the messag clear human feel thi movi funni and someon fan american humor that big one but i laugh entir movi i also share tear i love america monologu womanhood i love dame helen mirren narratorgreat choic margot star her barbi authent she portray comedi well emot part charact well that last scene good now i cant skip star film ryan gossl ken hilari i quot rest life but also show greta sweet men offer compass show enough dont greta noah realli made beauti love letter womanhood show part itpleas scene old ladi heart overal alreadi classic movi probabl one comfort movi
Not so unique as expected,"The concept of a Barbie movie is really unique and got me all exited. But unfortunately to me it delivers the same messages that we keep hearing as of lately.It started off quite funny, but after 45 minutes or so, the movie went in a direction I did not like. It took itself a bit too serious. I would have preferred a more lighthearted movie.Ryan Gosling did the best job out of everyone playing Ken I thought. The perfect guy with the perfect body and yet very campy, girly and insecure.

"Charming, fun and we all had a laugh.",This movie is charming and many people I know who also watched this absolutely loved it and recommended it to me. The movie was hilarious and we all had a laugh. Everybody enjoyed this and actually had fun. At the end of the movie I was left with wanting more. This movie is at least in the top 5 as it was something I didn't expect to enjoy. I thought at first that it would just another mediocre movie but I was so wrong. Somehow everything about this movie put together worked so well. Ryan Gosling as Ken and Margot Robbie as Barbie both casts did a fantastic job. I would absolutely rewatch this as it was better than I expected. I highly recommend this. This Barbie movie got everybody wearing pink and it just did everything right.

Barbie land and reality,"Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. I think people who played with Barbie dolls or just know the universe will be happy; they have a lot of references to the world and a lot of Barbie references to the dolls and the differents clothes and the impact of her in society. Some moments were also absurd ( the fight with all the Kens). Its good anyway.",barbi land realiti,im realli disappoint love movi honest it kind weird strang begin understand later barbi world so play cultur refer barbi doll repres ideal world woman power thing get pretti normal enter real world problem sexual remark woman place societi inequ men i pretti sure talk problem woman complex barbi perfect woman contrast real world it pretti obviou talk i love also ken also notic men power real world like everyon see realiti realli perceiv realiti power shift also later barbi land i understand act like stuff didnt realli get movi honest identifi talk societi busi music thing choregraphi even moral kind superfici but enjoy barbi realis problem world compar some moment funni seriou drama sometim even pretti soft barbi land i mean spend great time kind ok and still think great barbi movi task easi repres world enjoy set design color camera movement i think peopl play barbi doll know univers happi lot refer world lot barbi refer doll differ cloth impact societi some moment also absurd fight ken it good anyway
Preacher Barbie?,"I believe I came to this movie with an open mind. In my opinion a movie balled Barbie needs to be a comedy. And while there were pieces here and there that were funny, for the most part we (and everyone in the theater) only laughed occasionally. The production design and costumes are great. The screenplay is the weakest part. The direction is next weakest. And those two caused a great cast to overact. When this movie takes itself seriously it gets tedious. It's preachy. We are constantly being told what we are seeing and what we should think about what we are thinking. This is not engaging. Why can't we think for ourselves based on what we see? I hated being treated like a ten year old and being spoonfed the morals, thoughts and feelings. But then maybe the target audience is ten-year-olds. In any event, I thought it would never end. By the time they were talking about ordinary Barbie, all I could think was ""Sanctimonious Barbie.""",preacher barbi,i believ i came movi open mind in opinion movi ball barbi need comedi and piec funni part everyon theater laugh occasion the product design costum great the screenplay weakest part the direct next weakest and two caus great cast overact when movi take serious get tediou it preachi we constantli told see think think thi engag whi cant think base see i hate treat like ten year old spoonf moral thought feel but mayb target audienc tenyearold in event i thought would never end by time talk ordinari barbi i could think sanctimoni barbi
Greta Gerwig never disappoints,"I hope you won't let the title of the film fool you; this is not some family movie for little girls. It is an all around auteuristic film by the ever great Greta Gerwig, and an instant classic cult film.It provides some excellent comedy, and at the same time some very clever contemporary commentary on feminism and patriarchy from both sides, in Gerwig and Baumbach's usual styles. Very well-written overall.The cinematography is very uqique, one might say characteristic from Gerwig, but it has its own unique weird, twisted style to it. And I love it.Overall, a very fun film that is certainly deserving of all the praise and hype it has gotten.Like last year's ""Everything and Everywhere all att once"", this is truly a genre-bending experience that I very much hope make it to the Oscars.

Quite disappointing,"Some friends freaking out that I went to see Barbie lol I mean I mentioned I went coz my sister insisted since ages. Anyway the movie was bad. These days, every other director and producer wants to convey messages about women rights and feminism through whatever platform possible and this movie was a perfect example of that with sheer cringe to convey all that. I wished I had gotten the ticket for Oppenheimer in the same timings as my sister's Barbie show. Other than that, the acting done by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was great so can't take that away from them. They did justice to their roles.",quit disappoint,some friend freak i went see barbi lol i mean i mention i went coz sister insist sinc age anyway movi bad these day everi director produc want convey messag woman right femin whatev platform possibl movi perfect exampl sheer cring convey i wish i gotten ticket oppenheim time sister barbi show other act done margot robbi ryan gosl great cant take away they justic role
How is this movie so popular?,"I realise that I am hardly the target audience of this movie, but even so, slogging trough the movie I am baffled as to what the appeal is? There must be something with all the money it made at the box office, right? I haven't read any other reviews yet so as not to spoil my own impression of the movie.I've waited for the home release and I will admit, I fell asleep a couple times and am not compelled at all to rewatch the movie any time soon.There are some visual gags and some good jokes but I felt like those kind of ran out in the first 20 minutes or so. Once you get pass the novelty of the movie, what else is there? Not much in my opinion. The only thing that could hold my interest was Ken and his subplot, but the things happening around and to Barbie I couldn't care less about. The movie didn't make me care at all about anything that happened and as such left me bored and looking at my watch. The ending scene I pretty much fast forwarded. If there was supposed to be any kind of emotional response, I detected none. Is I said, sure, I am not the target audience but the movie being so successful I expected at least something other than boredom. My only emotional response I guess is sadness, because of the inevitable copycats and sequels that will try and leech of the success of Barbie, which isn't any good in the first place.Edit: In hindsight I reviewed my rating and gave a bit more, because days later stuff like the Mojo Dojo Casa House, or I'm just Ken just stuck with me more than I like to admit so there are memorable things and as I said, the opening of the movie is indeed fun. I still think they ran out of ideas and weren't sure how to end things and as such would be weary of a sequel given that there weren't enough ideas for a single movie IMO.",how movi popular,i realis i hardli target audienc movi even slog trough movi i baffl appeal there must someth money made box offic right i havent read review yet spoil impress movieiv wait home releas i admit i fell asleep coupl time compel rewatch movi time soonther visual gag good joke i felt like kind ran first minut onc get pas novelti movi el not much opinion the thing could hold interest ken subplot thing happen around barbi i couldnt care le the movi didnt make care anyth happen left bore look watch the end scene i pretti much fast forward if suppos kind emot respons i detect none is i said sure i target audienc movi success i expect least someth boredom my emot respons i guess sad inevit copycat sequel tri leech success barbi isnt good first placeedit in hindsight i review rate gave bit day later stuff like mojo dojo casa hous im ken stuck i like admit memor thing i said open movi inde fun i still think ran idea werent sure end thing would weari sequel given werent enough idea singl movi imo
Incredibly fun film that has important messages,"Margot Robbie is the best possible choice to play Barbie and Ryan Gosling is terrific as Ken. It's a very interesting story and not one I would automatically expect from a Barbie movie, but I love how it dives deep into the complexities of gender roles. It shows the negative impacts that a society dominated by one certain gender can have (female in Barbie Land and male in the real world) and we see why it's important to try and understand everyone's perspective. I also love how this movie dives into men's mental health with Ken's arc. It's something that gets overlooked in society and I adore how we got to see Ken learn to come to terms with who he is without Barbie and realize that he is enough just being himself. The movie gives a great arc to Barbie as she tries to understand her purpose. She realizes that the world of extreme happiness that she has been raised in isn't what she wants anymore. There are so many beautiful scenes where Barbie experiences the highs and lows of everyday humanity and in the end she chooses that she wants to become a real human. At first she starts off thinking that she's a great role model because she is always happy and positive but learns there are so many complexities to life that she was oblivious to. She becomes prepared to take on the challenge of being a human because she is desperate to feel something real. It's a great story and Greta Gerwig did a brilliant job directing. The set designs are very impressive and lots of shots are very beautiful. The movie is also very funny and the details and references to Barbie as a brand show just how much care was put into this movie. The music is incredible, there are so many songs in here that are great, but Ryan Gosling's performance of I'm Just Ken and Billie Eilish's What Was I Made For are my favorites. They do a great job representing the themes of the movie. If I had some complaints I think sometimes the movie is a bit heavy handed in its messaging and there are a couple of side characters that are a tad annoying but overall Barbie is a success. 8/10.",incred fun film import messag,margot robbi best possibl choic play barbi ryan gosl terrif ken it interest stori one i would automat expect barbi movi i love dive deep complex gender role it show neg impact societi domin one certain gender femal barbi land male real world see import tri understand everyon perspect i also love movi dive men mental health ken arc it someth get overlook societi i ador got see ken learn come term without barbi realiz enough the movi give great arc barbi tri understand purpos she realiz world extrem happi rais isnt want anymor there mani beauti scene barbi experi high low everyday human end choos want becom real human at first start think she great role model alway happi posit learn mani complex life oblivi she becom prepar take challeng human desper feel someth real it great stori greta gerwig brilliant job direct the set design impress lot shot beauti the movi also funni detail refer barbi brand show much care put movi the music incred mani song great ryan gosl perform im just ken billi eilish what wa i made for favorit they great job repres theme movi if i complaint i think sometim movi bit heavi hand messag coupl side charact tad annoy overal barbi success
Too overrated,"Its like watching at ""Truman's show"" but all the set it's pink color with a hint of extreme feminist ideas. I grew up with barbie dolls and I felt very disappointed, I was expecting a different kind of story, the ending was the worst. I think the message should be more with the real feminist concept of Simone de Bouvoir, we all deserve the same rights. In the end Instead of just Barbie Land they should changed as; Barbie and Ken Land.Definitely is not the best movie of Greta.I enjoyed the music, the set and loved the clothes.

Barbie existentialism.,"Barbie, the doll that destroyed stereotypes and taboos to later generate new ones and destroy them again, arrives at the cinema for the first time and does so masterfully. ""Barbie"" is a film that portrays misogyny from the perspective of the famous doll, the script is a biting criticism of patriarchy, internal problems within feminism, family and social relationships, consumerism and existentialism, all full of humor, in some scenes with a lot of black humor and the result is excellent, capturing what it wants to convey to the public. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is magnificent and together with the production design they bring a fictional country full of fantastic and pink plastics. The soundtrack is tremendous, with a list of songs wisely chosen (with some exceptions). The cast is tremendous, Margot Robbie's performance is realistic and sentimental, proving to be the perfect Barbie in all aspects. Ryan Gosling plays Ken with humor and also gives him perfect dramatic nuances. America Ferrara as a working mother achieves a performance to remember, especially for her powerful monologue. Kate McKinnon gives a highly comic performance and an endearing character of a very unusual Barbie. Rhea Perlman pulls off an incredible performance wittily balancing comedy and drama. Ann Roth in a special participation of a single dialogue and a smile achieved a sublime and unforgettable performance. Helen Mirren with a voice acting as The Narrator describes everything with feeling and passion taking advantage of her imposing voice. Greta Gerwig's work as a director is genius, she manages to capture the ideas of the script, gives it her own style and pays homage to movie classics.

Interesting concept but not as deep as expected,"The movie isn't as fantastic as it was hyped to be. Its deconstruction of patriarchy and satire fall short of what was expected. Instead, it seems to remain on a rather superficial level of ""girls can do anything"" and ""find yourself."" The most controversial aspect of the Barbie character, whether it exacerbates women's appearance anxiety, is hardly mentioned at all. In my view, it's essentially a reiteration of the same old themes, just presented in updated ways. However, considering Hollywood's consistent conservatism and focus on profits, I appreciate that this is a brave attempt at expressing feminism within the world's most profit-driven film industry.",interest concept deep expect,the movi isnt fantast hype it deconstruct patriarchi satir fall short expect instead seem remain rather superfici level girl anyth find the controversi aspect barbi charact whether exacerb woman appear anxieti hardli mention in view essenti reiter old theme present updat way howev consid hollywood consist conservat focu profit i appreci brave attempt express femin within world profitdriven film industri

A real mixed bag,"BARBIE is a film I find incredibly difficult to both review and rate. On the face of it, the trappings are pitiful and the tone is all over the place. The audience I saw it with were laughing at the dumbest jokes imaginable (like Gosling bouncing off the plastic wave) and missing all of the depth, which is what I personally found appealing. It's very hard to take such a tongue-in-cheek approach seriously, but then you could argue that it's deliberately bad, deliberately plasticky. Not that that excuses the bad acting from the likes of Ferrera et al. Despite this, the film's skewering of the patriarchy is spot-on, and Gosling turns out to be very good, stealing the film from the others. So it's a film I appreciate some parts of, and not others.",a real mix bag,barbi film i find incred difficult review rate on face trap piti tone place the audienc i saw laugh dumbest joke imagin like gosl bounc plastic wave miss depth i person found appeal it hard take tongueincheek approach serious could argu deliber bad deliber plasticki not excus bad act like ferrera et al despit film skewer patriarchi spoton gosl turn good steal film other so film i appreci part other
Preach Preach Preach,"Let me start by saying that I'm by no means a conservative or traditional woman. I believe that inequality for women still is rampant even in first world countries and that we go through many problems. But damn...this movie is so corporate and shallow. It's clearly ordered and tailored by executives at Mattel to rebrand and sell more dolls. The movie starts well and has the potential of becoming something very good, but then it just goes downhill: the premise of the owner's feeling being projected onto the doll was going to lead to a very nice build up about a person's life journey and then Barbie and Ken go to the human world and cue in the speeches and preaching. This movie suffers from a bad case of showing and not telling, they keep repeating the same dialogues: patriarchy bad patriarchy bad patriarchy bad sexism sexism sexism, not even one time but MULTIPLE TIMES. These characters go into random rants like its a ted talk! The chemistry between the mother and daughter is absolutely nonexistent and their relationship is so cringe, You cant root for them or feel their feelings at all. Barbie should have understood how Kens had been feeling in the Barbieland the whole time which is a mimic of how many women are still treated in the society: just existing for the gaze of a woman (man). Yet what do they do? They manipulate them (with a super nonsense plan) and force them back to their original position while she gives him a half assed apology that could have been done better and end up to a more accurate point about equality. (I guess this is again meta and a reflection of how women are pitted against each other while people in charge benefit from that but its so badly done that it feels meh.)
I can imagine that in the boardroom they went through a discussion like this: People are going to think this is a feel good movie so we need to give them something deeper but also lets make it absurd and fast paced so that we can finish the plot quickly and also jump on the ""not taking itself serious"" bandwagon and also market these dolls again in the age of smartphone kids. The only reason this movie gets at 5 from me is the humor, which sometimes becomes very meta and creative and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have acted very well. Besides this, they could have just given us a simple feel good movie and I would have respected the creators more.

This film is hilarious, with a few emotional scenes that will make you tear up & a beautiful message at the end. The production design by Sarah Greenwood is awe-inspiring. All the songs are foot-tappingly flawless. The choreography is faultless. Margot Robbie is outstanding as Barbie. Robbie's multi-layered portrayal of the titular character, proves that she's the perfect choice to play Barbie. Ryan Gosling is spectacular as Ken. Gosling portrays a wide range of emotions, effortlessly. Ryan Gosling's Ken is the highlight of the movie. America Ferrera is fantastic as Gloria. Ariana Greenblatt is awesome as Sasha.

This Barbie is dissapointed.,"Yes. Day by day it becomes more obvious that now the movies are made just because of the income they generate and nothing else. Ok, Barbie itself was not a creative idea, I know. And actually I didn't expect to see something unseen something unique in the first place, all in all it's ""Barbie"".But wouldn't you agree with me in that it could have been excelled better? It totally could have been. This movie has a huge budget. Then why such a mediocre story at best? I'm not saying it was a bad movie as well, but it was just ""ok"". Just that.Nowadays movies have become nothing else but live-actions, sequels and prequels. Now it seems like the only thing matters is to have known faces in your movie and the promotions; and creating a story and excelling it good became the least important components of a movie. Unfortunately, Barbie does not fall short in these criterias.",thi barbi dissapoint,ye day day becom obviou movi made incom gener noth el ok barbi creativ idea i know and actual i didnt expect see someth unseen someth uniqu first place barbiebut wouldnt agre could excel better it total could thi movi huge budget then mediocr stori best im say bad movi well ok just thatnowaday movi becom noth el liveact sequel prequel now seem like thing matter known face movi promot creat stori excel good becam least import compon movi unfortun barbi fall short criterion
"A trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes","The big summer blockbuster of 2023 is a wonderful visual spectacle with a great deal of creative physical comedy, centered in and around the universe of Barbie, Mattel's historic toy doll. Unfortunately, the film tries to be and do much more than what the filmmakers ultimately are able to control and reel in. That a movie about Barbie would be guilty of Americanization is no surprise, and in many ways more than befitting, but the Americanization here isn't just about the history of the toy itself and all its cultural impacts - Barbie also views everything through the eyes of Hollywood anno 2023 - which arguably is a very particular and perhaps not that representative outlook. Instead of utilizing the fine foundation laid in the film's first third, director and co-writer Greta Gervig (Lady Bird, Little Women) gets herself lost in a trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes, which will leave youths - and perhaps particularly Europeans - feeling confused and conflicted. The filmmakers' supposed toying with stereotypes ultimately becomes more of a playing into them, especially towards the end when Gerwig staggers along desperately looking for closure and something meaningful to say. Alas, Barbie has ended up as a rather sad symptom of our times, when it could have been the wonderfully funny piece of femininity-appraising escapism it started out as. There are nonetheless several highlights here, such as the delightfully absurd opening sequence (a fine nod to Kubrick's 2001), the initial introduction of Barbie and Ken's days in Barbieland, and - of course - their first encounter with the real world.",a trite divis like futil battl sex,the big summer blockbust wonder visual spectacl great deal creativ physic comedi center around univers barbi mattel histor toy doll unfortun film tri much filmmak ultim abl control reel that movi barbi would guilti american surpris mani way befit american isnt histori toy cultur impact barbi also view everyth eye hollywood anno arguabl particular perhap repres outlook instead util fine foundat laid film first third director cowrit greta gervig ladi bird littl woman get lost trite divis like futil battl sex leav youth perhap particularli european feel confus conflict the filmmak suppos toy stereotyp ultim becom play especi toward end gerwig stagger along desper look closur someth meaning say ala barbi end rather sad symptom time could wonder funni piec femininityapprais escap start there nonetheless sever highlight delight absurd open sequenc fine nod kubrick initi introduct barbi ken day barbieland cours first encount real world
The movie event of 2023 lives up to the hype,Let me start by saying it makes me happy to see a movie that isn't from the MCU or a sequel doing so well at the box office. There is still originality out there. This movie was very funny - the scene with Ken and the doctor in LA made me laugh very hard. It's weird and inventive. It has amazing choreography. So many talented people worked on this. I didn't grow up with Barbies so I'm sure a lot of the jokes went over my head. But it didn't hurt the enjoyment. It even manages to land a sentimental note at the end. I can definitely see this being a movie people see over and over.Side note: Greta Gerwig must be a fan of Sex Education - three actors end up here.,the movi event live hype,let start say make happi see movi isnt mcu sequel well box offic there still origin thi movi funni scene ken doctor la made laugh hard it weird invent it amaz choreographi so mani talent peopl work i didnt grow barbi im sure lot joke went head but didnt hurt enjoy it even manag land sentiment note end i definit see movi peopl see oversid note greta gerwig must fan sex educ three actor end
I had no expectations but was still underwhelmed,"I loved barbie growing up, and even at 42 years old I couldn't wait to go see the movie! I didn't have any expectations because I had no idea how they could make a movie about barbie that's for adults and not kids. I adored Barbieland, but unfortunately they leave it behind so fast and with it they also leave behind everything good about bringing barbie to life in a movie! It got silly, had no storyline, was overly political and woke, man bashing and made men silly, and I really didn't care for the ending which is just as well because it was abrupt and crude.The music is good, but I wasn't prepared for a musical and it became that for some unknown reason at one point.Ryan Gosling as Ken stole the show. He looked like he was having the time of his life making this movie!Margot Robbie is perfect as Barbie but it wasn't that interesting to watch and I didn't understand why she was being forced to get in the box and what would happen if she did get in.",i expect still underwhelm,i love barbi grow even year old i couldnt wait go see movi i didnt expect i idea could make movi barbi that adult kid i ador barbieland unfortun leav behind fast also leav behind everyth good bring barbi life movi it got silli storylin overli polit woke man bash made men silli i realli didnt care end well abrupt crudeth music good i wasnt prepar music becam unknown reason one pointryan gosl ken stole show he look like time life make moviemargot robbi perfect barbi wasnt interest watch i didnt understand forc get box would happen get
If imagination was a movie,"This fulfills my childhood in a way I could never have anticipated. It reflects upon the flaws of our world and helps us all accept them by also accepting the imperfections in ourselves, like the fact that we are all a little dark and weird and crazy sometimes. And that doesn't make us any less men or women, or whater we are or want to be.It gives agency to all our wildest thoughts by putting the innocence of childhood in the context of the real world that all adolscents must eventually enter. It convinces me that someone out there thinks of the world in the same unique optimistic way as I do. And that's enough. Growing up is mandatory. But it doesn't have to be uncomfortable or ugly.

Did I just watch a 2hr Mattel advertisement?,"BARBIE is a great example of hype over substance. It is laugh out loud at times and Gosling steals every scene he's in. The art direction is on point. What makes it tiresome is THE MESSAGE pummelled into the audience, but then were we expecting any subtly? Probably not. Ultimately my wife just thought, 'I already know this. I don't need to hear it. But maybe some women do?' I get her point. In the end it felt like we were being sold Barbie Dolls as some kind of icon of feminism. But seriously, they are a very poor example of female role models. Not surprisingly Mattel was one of the producers.",did i watch hr mattel advertis,barbi great exampl hype substanc it laugh loud time gosl steal everi scene he the art direct point what make tiresom the messag pummel audienc expect subtli probabl ultim wife thought i alreadi know i dont need hear but mayb woman i get point in end felt like sold barbi doll kind icon femin but serious poor exampl femal role model not surprisingli mattel one produc
Big hype and the result is a mirror of today's society,"Margot Robbie had a vision, and she was the driving force to get the Barbie movie produced by none other than world-class director Greta Gerwig.The beginning of the movie brings us back to the first trailers for the movie, when little girls discovered a new doll, the first Barbie. She was different than any other doll because she was not a baby-doll, no, she was a woman-doll; a doll which could inspire the imagination and aspiration of children.Margot Robbie plays the main character ""stereotypical Babie"" and brings her to life in every detail and introduces us to Barbieworld with all her friends. The perfect repeated ""best day every day"" gets disrupted by unknown circumstances and ""stereotypical Barbie"" accompanied by ""her"" Ken, portrayed by Ryan Gosling go on an adventure of their lifetime to the ""real world"". The discoveries and experiences that these two make have major impacts in both worlds.This movie is worthwhile watching for the costumes and displays as much as for the social criticism of our time. The words of Gloria's (America Ferrera) speech hit the nail on its head regarding the daily struggles of women in our modern world. This movie is a depiction of reality and a dream world. It shows the possibilities as much as the shortcomings of our times with humor and fun, a little bit of sarcasm, paired with the innocence of someone new to our reality!Highly recommended for everyone who is not too shy to face real world struggle in a pink coated Barbie world.",big hype result mirror today societi,margot robbi vision drive forc get barbi movi produc none worldclass director greta gerwigth begin movi bring u back first trailer movi littl girl discov new doll first barbi she differ doll babydol womandol doll could inspir imagin aspir childrenmargot robbi play main charact stereotyp babi bring life everi detail introduc u barbieworld friend the perfect repeat best day everi day get disrupt unknown circumst stereotyp barbi accompani ken portray ryan gosl go adventur lifetim real world the discoveri experi two make major impact worldsthi movi worthwhil watch costum display much social critic time the word gloria america ferrera speech hit nail head regard daili struggl woman modern world thi movi depict realiti dream world it show possibl much shortcom time humor fun littl bit sarcasm pair innoc someon new realityhighli recommend everyon shi face real world struggl pink coat barbi world
Life is plastic!,"Firstly, let's start with what was good about Barbie and move forward from there. The colourful palette, the set designs and costumes were perfect to bring you into a world that doesn't take itself too seriously. Barbie wasn't meant to get all philosophical and it wasn't necessarily supposed to provide us with a point. What it gave little girls is happiness and entertainment value. In the early stages of the movie it undoubtedly had potential to be a lot of fun with a comedic effect.This silly satire soon finds itself covering too much ground about how the world of Barbie is female dominant, alongside how the real world is male dominant. It evolves into a feminist movement film that is a little dated, then slowly back peddles and suggests everyone should be who they want to be. That all you have to do is find out who you are and what your purpose is. It almost becomes lost within its own thought pattern without really conveying anything meaningful. It feels like a load of thoughts with no conclusion or that somebody has thrown a pad of post-it notes in the air. The musical tone and lighthearted comedy that seemed set to propel this movie into box office glory, felt neglected to some extent, when real world themes were contemplated. What was working at first will slowly devour with over dramatic speeches of everything that is wrong with a male dominated world. As well as other complaints about having so much on your plate and being too god damn tired.Barbie finds herself wanting to leave Barbieland to feel real emotions rather than go through day to day life like everything is perfect. The cross-over between worlds worked to some degree, to me it was showing the girl leaving behind her dolls and becoming a woman to join the sometimes scary, but real world. (Margot Robbie) portrays Barbie very simplistic, her approach works as that seems to be what Greta Gerwig aimed to show. Greta Gerwig differentiates the worlds developing both Barbie and Ken as they learn from their experience interacting with the real world. There appeared to be references to the Matrix to me as Barbie is given a choice between staying in Barbie world or going to the real world to discover what's causing her malfunctions. Also the owner Ruth Marianna Handler gives off an Oracle vibe in the scene where she offers Barbie tea. One little girl blames Barbie claiming she set women back decades making them stereotypical girly girls without a purpose except looking pretty putting clothes on and off and doing house chores.(Ryan Gosling) gives Ken a lot of charisma and is purposely obnoxious at times creating an antagonist for Barbie. The Ken's are portrayed as weak little love puppies in Barbie world without a purpose juxtaposed with how women are received in the real world. Gosling reminds me of a wrestling villain that the crowd are wanting to hate on, he is a little over the top as he is turned against his fellow Ken's by Barbie manipulation. The poor performance of Gosling attempting to cry towards the climax added to the later half of the movie losing it way. It all becomes a little too silly leaving the audience flabbergasted at what absurdity they just witnessed.",life plastic,firstli let start good barbi move forward the colour palett set design costum perfect bring world doesnt take serious barbi wasnt meant get philosoph wasnt necessarili suppos provid u point what gave littl girl happi entertain valu in earli stage movi undoubtedli potenti lot fun comed effectthi silli satir soon find cover much ground world barbi femal domin alongsid real world male domin it evolv feminist movement film littl date slowli back peddl suggest everyon want that find purpos it almost becom lost within thought pattern without realli convey anyth meaning it feel like load thought conclus somebodi thrown pad postit note air the music tone lightheart comedi seem set propel movi box offic glori felt neglect extent real world theme contempl what work first slowli devour dramat speech everyth wrong male domin world a well complaint much plate god damn tiredbarbi find want leav barbieland feel real emot rather go day day life like everyth perfect the crossov world work degre show girl leav behind doll becom woman join sometim scari real world margot robbi portray barbi simplist approach work seem greta gerwig aim show greta gerwig differenti world develop barbi ken learn experi interact real world there appear refer matrix barbi given choic stay barbi world go real world discov what caus malfunct also owner ruth marianna handler give oracl vibe scene offer barbi tea one littl girl blame barbi claim set woman back decad make stereotyp girli girl without purpos except look pretti put cloth hous choresryan gosl give ken lot charisma purpos obnoxi time creat antagonist barbi the ken portray weak littl love puppi barbi world without purpos juxtapos woman receiv real world gosl remind wrestl villain crowd want hate littl top turn fellow ken barbi manipul the poor perform gosl attempt cri toward climax ad later half movi lose way it becom littl silli leav audienc flabbergast absurd wit

Barbie is a masterpiece and I'm not joking,"I'm not a Barbie fan. The only time I loved Barbie was when she was in the Toy Story movies. But that changed after I saw the Barbie movie. This movie is not only Greta Gerwig's best film but also the year's greatest movie so far!!!!! Margot Robbie (my favorite actress of all time) is beautiful and portrays Barbie with pure perfection!!! And then there's Ken (played by Ryan Gosling in a career-best performance)!!! Robbie and Gosling shine and are easily the years best duo.The story starts with Barbie doing her usual routine in Barbieland, a land filled with multiple Barbies, each with a different occupation. The Ken's also visit playing the roles a woman would play. Barbie starts experiencing real emotional symptoms like thinking about death, crying and flat feet. She learns from Weird Barbie that the Real World will have the answers to her questions. Barbie than travels with Ken to the real world and find out many things : Barbie is a doll played by a grown woman named Gloria (America Ferrera in her best movie performance), Mattel wants to put Barbie back in the box and Ken learns about America's patriarchy and men rule the world. All of these problems combine into a hilarious comedy that provides great messages about woman empowerment and being who you want to be.The production design of Barbieland and costumes of all the Barbies and Kens are Oscar-worthy. The soundtrack is pretty solid with two great songs: Ryan Gosling's 80s ballad called I'm Just Ken and Billie Ellish's emotional song at the end of the movie, ""What was I made for?"".The direction of Greta Gerwig is finally put to great use in Barbie as she's goes to make the best comedy in years and the script she wrote with her partner Noah Baumbach is the perfect mixture of stupid comedy, great-comedy drama and emotional drama.Gosling gives his best and definitely deserves an Oscar nomination as his role of Ken is up there with the comedy greats of Meliss Mccarthy in Bridesmaids and Robert Downey Jr. In Tropic Thunder.The real scene stealer is Margot Robbie. Robbie has been in multiple box office failures but Barbie changed that. She's been nominated twice for the Oscar for her incredible performances in I, Tonya and Bombshell. My favorite actress is about to be nominated for Best Actress and Best Picture for Barbie!!!! Margot Robbie is astonishing and a tour de force in Barbie, which is the best performance of her whole career!!! Go Margot Robbie!!!!!This movie is definitely worth watching!!!!!!

I'm a middle aged man with daughters. I liked it.,"I suspect this is a personal thing. Who you are defines what you may get from this.Me - I'm well into my mid life (had my crisis already thank you). I have daughters and both have watched this. I'm also pretty laid back to life. I encourage my children to be whatever the heck they wanna be and help them as much as I can.Now to the movie.For an afternoon showing, it was 2/3 full and mostly women and girls. Just an observation. But it was.The film is fun. It's tootles along with lots of off beat moments, a great monologue near the end (got teary there), silliness and self awareness (lots of self referential humour).My girls enjoyed it. I did too but not sure it's like 9/10 good. It's definitely enjoyable but 7/10 good.A Barbie movie could have been really bad. Really it could have been. But as has been shown by Lego movie, Detective Pickachu and few others....you can take something predominantly aimed at children and make it into something that both adults and children can engage with.The core message is great.I must say, I have heard a lot about Ryan Gosling being funny. He's ok. At least to me, he wasn't laugh out loud funny. There are much funnier things in this.But it is funny and enjoyable enough.Will Barbie dramatically change the landscape for dialogue? No, I don't think it will.

Plastic in the worst way possible,"It took me quite some time to decipher this movie. I felt like I was missing something, that there was more to it than first apparent. The acting, the dialogue, the sets, the costume: technically it is polished and purposeful; yet I was utterly unable to engage with it. And finally it hit me: that is because it is actually a commercial.Moreover it is nothing else than a commercial. It doesn't deliver anything more than promote a product. Take the product away and there is nothing. Take away Barbie the brand, and the film is devoid of any substance. It's empty. Unlike the Lego movie for instance, similarly an unapologetic ad for children's toys, that managed to be a decent adventure film that celebrated the creativity that toys enable.Barbie functions as a film but only on the most superficial ways.It has a story, characters and lines of dialogue. And while some of the dialogue is clever and funny, and some of the characterization opens the door to some interesting character study, overall it is weighted down by the absolute obtuseness of the plot. The worst flaw is that it doesnt give anything of substance to do to Barbie, the protagonist. Almost every other character is moving the plot forward by either taking action or moving the story forward by emotional growth. Barbie herself is just a side character that goes from A to B and back to A. Physically, as well as emotionally. Ken has a far more interesting journey and arc. Gloria has a more important role in the story. Arguably even Sasha and Allen work better as characters with whom you relate and empathise.The worst thing is that the movie is not even a commercial for the dolls. Rather it is a commercial for the idea of the doll. I don't know if we can get more post-modern than that. Barbie is not an actual doll in the movie, but she is literally the thing you think of when you describe someone as a ""Barbie"" Yet the film is very much so a commercial for Mattel's Barbie and the intellectual property it represents. I think it is crass and pedestrian. The movie is purely a corporate maneuver to pivot from one business to another, from manufacturing toys to manufacturing content.That is why this film throws so much at the wall to see what sticks; that is why when Barbie leaves fake plastic Barbie-land, she escapes to fake plastic Los Angeles and nobody picks up on the irony. That's why they have garbage collector Barbies in a world where there is no garbage. That's why they have women Barbie doctors that aren't actual doctors and when later Ken meets a real doctor in the real world, you're waiting for a call-back that never happens.This movie is the absolute opposite of art. To call it a film is an insult to everything we hold sacred.",plastic worst way possibl,it took quit time deciph movi i felt like i miss someth first appar the act dialogu set costum technic polish purpos yet i utterli unabl engag and final hit actual commercialmoreov noth el commerci it doesnt deliv anyth promot product take product away noth take away barbi brand film devoid substanc it empti unlik lego movi instanc similarli unapologet ad child toy manag decent adventur film celebr creativ toy enablebarbi function film superfici waysit stori charact line dialogu and dialogu clever funni character open door interest charact studi overal weight absolut obtus plot the worst flaw doesnt give anyth substanc barbi protagonist almost everi charact move plot forward either take action move stori forward emot growth barbi side charact goe a b back a physic well emot ken far interest journey arc gloria import role stori arguabl even sasha allen work better charact relat empathiseth worst thing movi even commerci doll rather commerci idea doll i dont know get postmodern barbi actual doll movi liter thing think describ someon barbi yet film much commerci mattel barbi intellectu properti repres i think crass pedestrian the movi pure corpor maneuv pivot one busi anoth manufactur toy manufactur contentthat film throw much wall see stick barbi leav fake plastic barbieland escap fake plastic lo angel nobodi pick ironi that garbag collector barbi world garbag that woman barbi doctor arent actual doctor later ken meet real doctor real world your wait callback never happensthi movi absolut opposit art to call film insult everyth hold sacr
Not made for me but loved nonetheless,"As a man who has never touched a barbie in my life, I was definitely not the intended audience for this film. However, I absolutely enjoyed it. It's funny, entertaining, and poignant. I came in thinking it would be sort of silly and fun, which it was, but it also was about barbie, an always-positive ""person's"" journey into the real world and how messed up and unfair it is. She believes that the real world must be just like hers, where women are recognized for their achievements and always given the opportunity, respect, and tools to succeed in life. She is obviously very disappointed in our world when she actually experiences it.

I expect better from Greta Gerwig!,"When the execution banks on shrewd humour and clever writing, the movie thrives as a vivid spectacle, as a lighthearted entertainer, but whenever it delves deeper than the surface and enthusiastically seeks for the hidden under-layers, the psyches of Barbie and Ken, their understanding of the world and their impaired perspectives, the output just becomes so much fuller, the film comes to be something else altogether.However, the emotionally motivated instants seldom come out in the open, as the narrative, for the most part, leans on the fun, humorous side, and frankly speaking, it was bound to be like that.After all, it's a feature that is made mainly by keeping younger audiences in mind. It's just that Greta is a great storyteller, and I think highly of her directorial skills; thus, I expected to see more of 'her'!",i expect better greta gerwig,when execut bank shrewd humour clever write movi thrive vivid spectacl lightheart entertain whenev delv deeper surfac enthusiast seek hidden underlay psych barbi ken understand world impair perspect output becom much fuller film come someth el altogetherhowev emot motiv instant seldom come open narr part lean fun humor side frankli speak bound like thataft featur made mainli keep younger audienc mind it greta great storytel i think highli directori skill thu i expect see
"Life in plastic, it's fantastic!","It's an incredibly fun movie. Lots of laughs. Very campy over the top humour. But also surprisingly touching. My favourite scene of the movie is just rather a small quiet moment where Barbie is observing every day life and tells an old woman how beautiful she is. Margot Robbie shines in the lead role. Ryan Gosling clearly was having a lot of fun with the role, but don't sleep on Michael Cera as Allan. I know a lot of people say that Ryan Gosling is a scene stealer, but personally I thought Michael was.The soundtrack also works really within the film. I don't know how many of them I would listen to separately. I also wouldnt be suprised if either ""Im just Ken"" or ""What was I made for?"" or both was nominated for an oscar. Speaking of oscars, I think this is also has a good chance of being nominated for production design, costumes, hair and makeup - because visually this movie is such a treat.Now I dont think all aspects worked for me. I don't think the Mattel/CEO subplot was needed. There could have been another way for her to go back to Barbieland organically. I felt like the film was already tackling a lot with themes of patriarchy and feminism and having this ""chase scene"" didnt add much. Also, Gloria's (America Ferrera) monologue. Now, dont get me wrong I think there is a lot truth to it. But I just found it somewhat one-note. It didn't exactly blow me away as it has for others. And lastly, I undertstand the importance of having Ruth Handler featured in the movie....just a little weird that it was represented as her being a ghost that lives in Mattel headquarters.Overall, I would definitely recommend the film.

A Tale of Two Halves,"The movie starts in one direction and then changes course half way through to a rushed and unsatisfying end. The second hour of the movie is a stark contrast to the first hour. There were funny moments mixed with thoughtful gender roles, views on our patriarchal society, self-worth, etc. That took a complicated subject and made it interesting in the first half. The problem is, the movie then begins to take itself too seriously and the second half loses the clever comedy and pushes stereotypes of male and female gender roles in our society to become a rushed mess of a story that becomes preachy. There are a lot of issues in today's society with regards to gender roles, feminism, our patriarchal society, etc. The problem is the movie seems to take on some of these issues with comedy, then takes a more serious tone, and rushes through the second half so that characters brought forward in the first half have no real resolution. Sure Barbie finds her purpose at the movie's end, but it becomes a mess to get there. The rich comedy common in the first half turns to slapstick and serious drama. Are there two more opposites than slapstick and drama? The first half had me rethinking my views on how women are treated with it's lighthearted comedy, while the second half had me bothered by pushing male stereotypes into a slapstick war and a rush to finish while also being preached to about male and female gender roles. The movie seems to lose it's purpose and then rushes for a resolution. The mom and daughter story would have been better explored with a light hearted comedy that touches on gender roles and a woman's self-worth, and making it for the whole family but especially focused on an audience of young girls and women who are trying to figure out who they are. It really should have explored the mother and daughter characters and how they each struggle with being a woman in society and used Barbie as a tool of them helping to better understand each other. The movie glosses over this and despite their differences their complicated relationship is easily fixed as the focus turns back to Barbie and the focus on her. The movie brings up good ideas and a good story to once again have Hollywood ruin it. It loses focus as too many ideas, issues, characters, and plots, are brought up, to have it rushed to a finish with only some resolved. All a common problem with too many Hollywood movies these days. What is the purpose of your story? Who is it written for? Why are you writing it? Focus on that, and don't let others over complicate it. It's sad that a movie that brings up important issues especially with women's self-worth with both older and younger women is ruined by too much of everything else this movie takes on.",a tale two halv,the movi start one direct chang cours half way rush unsatisfi end the second hour movi stark contrast first hour there funni moment mix thought gender role view patriarch societi selfworth etc that took complic subject made interest first half the problem movi begin take serious second half lose clever comedi push stereotyp male femal gender role societi becom rush mess stori becom preachi there lot issu today societi regard gender role femin patriarch societi etc the problem movi seem take issu comedi take seriou tone rush second half charact brought forward first half real resolut sure barbi find purpos movi end becom mess get the rich comedi common first half turn slapstick seriou drama are two opposit slapstick drama the first half rethink view woman treat lightheart comedi second half bother push male stereotyp slapstick war rush finish also preach male femal gender role the movi seem lose purpos rush resolut the mom daughter stori would better explor light heart comedi touch gender role woman selfworth make whole famili especi focus audienc young girl woman tri figur it realli explor mother daughter charact struggl woman societi use barbi tool help better understand the movi gloss despit differ complic relationship easili fix focu turn back barbi focu the movi bring good idea good stori hollywood ruin it lose focu mani idea issu charact plot brought rush finish resolv all common problem mani hollywood movi day what purpos stori who written whi write focu dont let other complic it sad movi bring import issu especi woman selfworth older younger woman ruin much everyth el movi take
This is a work of art.,"This is a masterpiece with little to no short-cuts taken on everything that makes a film great - writing, wardrobe, make-up, choreography, set, acting etc. The cast is incredible. Margot Robbie fits the role of Barbie so well. Ryan Gosling (IMO) steals the show as Ken. I found his performance to be the stand-out. I always love seeing Issa Rae anywhere and I think she should be everywhere because she's so talented. I can't say enough about America Ferrera's monologue rant - the writing of that monologue was spectacular but Ferrera's delivery of it was one of my favourite scenes in this movie.I think Greta Gerwig's work here is incredible and I think this movie will be remembered for many years to come.",thi work art,thi masterpiec littl shortcut taken everyth make film great write wardrob makeup choreographi set act etc the cast incred margot robbi fit role barbi well ryan gosl imo steal show ken i found perform standout i alway love see issa rae anywher i think everywher she talent i cant say enough america ferrera monologu rant write monologu spectacular ferrera deliveri one favourit scene moviei think greta gerwig work incred i think movi rememb mani year come
Its just Barbie and Ken,"There's so much to say about the movie, so many points to touch on that I don't know how to express it correctly.Let me start by discussing a few parts that I really liked. First of all, Ryan Gosling's performance was amazing; it overshadowed everything in the film. A masterful and remarkable performance. While not Margot Robbie's best performance, she did quite well too. I didn't find the other actors or actresses quite as impressive.Another aspect I found impressive was the costumes; in my opinion, the film definitely deserved an Oscar for them. They were the best costumes I've seen in a long time. Similarly, the color coordination was superb.I also enjoyed the production; most things were cohesive from a technical standpoint. The comedy in the film was of good quality, and there were scenes that I really enjoyed and had a lot of fun watching.Now, moving on to the things I didn't like, and the area I'd like to emphasize the most - the screenplay. After watching a strong first half, I became very invested in the movie, but the ending suffocated me. Trying to convey so many messages felt utterly pointless. The film had already managed to balance comedy and drama in the first half; there was no need to forcefully shove these messages down our throats in such a contrived manner. I understood the message, but I ended up leaving the theater feeling frustrated.In addition, there's a part I absolutely disliked: Barbie's convincing Kens with their beauty and then reclaiming Barbie Land. It felt too simplistic and contradicted the main point of the movie. It definitely could have been written more cleverly. Moreover, the metaphorical scene of Classic Barbie talking to the creator (metaphorically) and visiting a gynecologist was harsh and not smartly executed. It was emotional, yes, but personally, it felt heavy.In short, summing up the technical aspects and acting, the film scored a 6.5 to 7 from me. However, the disjointedness of the screenplay and its excessive urge to convey messages left me extremely disappointed. Women are our treasures; we should stand firm against discrimination and support each other. Let's love one another, let's love our women - they are our mothers. They are all invaluable, and so are we. Hopefully, one day everyone will be equal, just like Barbie's aim, and you can achieve your goals just like Ken does.Note: Regardless of everything, people should stop comparing Barbie and Oppenheimer ; Barbie ran a crazy advertising campaign, and it's necessary to admit that their popularity and the pink frenzy are owed to their advertising efforts.",it barbi ken,there much say movi mani point touch i dont know express correctlylet start discus part i realli like first ryan gosl perform amaz overshadow everyth film a master remark perform while margot robbi best perform quit well i didnt find actor actress quit impressiveanoth aspect i found impress costum opinion film definit deserv oscar they best costum ive seen long time similarli color coordin superbi also enjoy product thing cohes technic standpoint the comedi film good qualiti scene i realli enjoy lot fun watchingnow move thing i didnt like area id like emphas screenplay after watch strong first half i becam invest movi end suffoc tri convey mani messag felt utterli pointless the film alreadi manag balanc comedi drama first half need forc shove messag throat contriv manner i understood messag i end leav theater feel frustratedin addit there part i absolut dislik barbi convinc ken beauti reclaim barbi land it felt simplist contradict main point movi it definit could written cleverli moreov metaphor scene classic barbi talk creator metaphor visit gynecologist harsh smartli execut it emot ye person felt heavyin short sum technic aspect act film score howev disjointed screenplay excess urg convey messag left extrem disappoint woman treasur stand firm discrimin support let love one anoth let love woman mother they invalu hope one day everyon equal like barbi aim achiev goal like ken doesnot regardless everyth peopl stop compar barbi oppenheim barbi ran crazi advertis campaign necessari admit popular pink frenzi owe advertis effort
More of a marketing flick,"The brilliant marketing is what led us tonight to pay for the tickets. The brilliance ends there.Performance of the lead actors is very good - as good as you may expect given the very poor story and weak directing. And that's it. The humour is forced. The satire is replaced by lectures conveyed by characters. All the ""bad"" characters are absolutely flat, lacking any depth. Even dancing is very poorly choreographed. Whatever you may expect from the trailers is missing in the movie.The photography is good though. So the average is 5/10

"Laugh, Reflect, Repeat: Exploring the Wonders of 'Barbie'","Oh my goodness, where do I even begin with ""Barbie"" (2023)? This film is an absolute delight and a true masterpiece that will leave you in awe. Directed by the incredibly talented Greta Gerwig and starring the stunning Margot Robbie as the iconic doll herself, ""Barbie"" is a cinematic experience like no other.From start to finish, ""Barbie"" captivates audiences with its seamless blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. Gerwig's direction is nothing short of brilliant as she brings the world of Barbie to life with a perfect balance of humor and depth. The humor, in particular, is off the charts hilarious, with giant laugh-out-loud moments that had me clutching my sides. It's remarkable how the humor appeals to viewers of all ages, making it one of the funniest movies of the year.But what truly sets ""Barbie"" apart is its profound and thought-provoking narrative. The film revolves around Barbie's existential crisis and her quest to find meaning in her existence. This exploration of Barbie's identity as a feminist symbol is incredibly compelling and challenges societal norms and expectations surrounding femininity and girlhood. Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals? This deep, existential question lingers long after the credits roll, prompting introspection and discussion.Margot Robbie's performance as Barbie is nothing short of extraordinary. She brings a charisma and depth to the character that is truly captivating. Watching her journey of self-discovery unfold on screen is an absolute joy. And let's not forget Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken, which complements Robbie's Barbie perfectly. Their on-screen chemistry is off the charts and adds another layer of excitement to the film.I should mention that ""Barbie"" has received widespread acclaim from both critics and audiences, and it's easy to see why. It strikes a perfect balance between appealing to longtime fans and captivating new audiences. The movie's mass appeal transcends age, gender, and previous Barbie doll opinions, making it a delightful and engaging experience for viewers of all backgrounds.Despite its PG-13 rating, ""Barbie"" remains family-friendly and suitable for teenagers and older kids. The clever marketing of the film ensures that it appeals to a wide range of audiences, making it a perfect choice for family movie nights.In conclusion, ""Barbie"" is an absolute triumph in every aspect of filmmaking. With its stellar cast, innovative approach, brilliant humor, and profound exploration of societal themes, it more than deserves a perfect 10/10 rating. This cinematic gem is a must-watch for anyone seeking an enchanting and thought-provoking experience that transcends the boundaries of age and nostalgia. Brace yourself to be dazzled and captivated by the delightful world of ""Barbie.""

"Colourful, but confusing","Who exactly was this film aimed at? Most of the audience when I saw it were adolescents, and there were numerous (perhaps too many) colourful song and dance scenes, which might have appealed to younger viewers, but also a lot of philosophical debate about gender roles and inter-relationships that would have gone over their heads, particularly as these were delivered at a frantic, garbled pace. There were some good comic scenes, and stand-out performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but as the film wore on, it all became a bit preachy. The message seemed to be about finding self-fulfilment rather than romance. Okay, not every film, or every life, has to end in a fairy-tale romantic coupling, but the emphasis on individual fulfilment within the support structure of the sisterhood seems a little bleak. It also makes nonsense of the final confusing pay-off line of the film.",colour confus,who exactli film aim most audienc i saw adolesc numer perhap mani colour song danc scene might appeal younger viewer also lot philosoph debat gender role interrelationship would gone head particularli deliv frantic garbl pace there good comic scene standout perform margot robbi ryan gosl film wore becam bit preachi the messag seem find selffulfil rather romanc okay everi film everi life end fairytal romant coupl emphasi individu fulfil within support structur sisterhood seem littl bleak it also make nonsens final confus payoff line film
"""Barbie"" is fun and visually beautiful, but unfortunately Barbie doll was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy","Despite the strong commercial tone, it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by Greta Gerwig, director known for dramatic comedies that capture the complexity of femininity in an original way - although, in this case, it is almost inevitable to fall into some clichés. The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. ""Barbie"" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the ""corporate"" issue. It won't be strange if you catch yourself thinking ""how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?"" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.In the debate proposal for important social disparities in the face of the artificial tackiness of the Barbie Universe, the direction manages to create precious dialogues and situations, very well dosed with humor and other variations of the dramatic genre that permeate the acts of the project. In these changes of atmosphere, we were able to appreciate the creative photography by Rodrigo Prieto - who shoots 50 shades of pink in the same scene without making us want to vomit - and the dozens of visual references that influenced the director in the aesthetic configuration, between composition of scenes and very particular plastic choices, such as costume pieces, type of hair or cinephile jokes that we had already had contact with since the trailer parodying 2001: A Space Odyssey. Here, we'll catch glimpses of ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""The Truman Show""; we'll go through the fairytale-like artificiality of Jacques Demy's films; for the dance and choreographic performance of Gene Kelly; for the visual and dramatic intensity of The Little Red Shoes and All That Jazz... it's a lot. ""Barbie"" is a well of enriching cinematographic references.But, leaving aside that the film is indeed fun and has a creative and stunning look, in addition to addressing important points of today's society, Greta Gerwig ends up exaggerating her hand and transforms ""Barbie"" into a blatant and extremely exaggerated feminist activism. The production is very much in line with a famous Quentin Tarantino interview in 2021 given to Bill Maher on his HBO broadcast ""Real Time"" in which he said: ""Ultimately, ideology trumps art, individual effort, good, entertainment"". Unfortunately, in this film, this doll that belonged to the imagination of several generations of women was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy, full of language, allegories, open messages and ideological discourses. The film misses an opportunity to be a film for everyone, to be a comedy and romance epic, and it had the quality to do so, but it preferred to focus on the most brazen militancy that cinema has ever produced, trying to please a specific audience and clearly attack certain targets of this ideological patrol.The film has an interesting premise, that's undeniable, and it flows most of the time, but the audience is bombarded with pervasive indoctrination especially in the art scene at every turn. Since the target audience here is females of all ages, this audience may even enter the cinema wanting to be entertained, but will graduate in all subjects addressed among feminists: an ode to the intrinsic evil of patriarchy; criticism of beauty standards; the hypocritical discourse against consumerism (as if Warner, Mattel, artists were not going to profit millions from movie ticket sales, from selling new dolls, etc.); man-hatred (all men portrayed in the film are portrayed as idi*ts, gr*edy, d*mb, or wanting power for themselves). Greta Gerwig's goal as a screenwriter is super smart in this regard, because the ""Stereotyped"" Barbie comes to the real world completely innocent and she is being indoctrinated following the feminist primer that shows how she has to think and act, mainly in the perception of men and progressive militancy - the character Sasha, played by Ariana Greenblatt, is the one who plays this role, like the militant of today, always connected and who knows everything about life (where Gerwig puts her speech in the mouth of the character so that she speaks her true s intentions).The truth is that the film essentially revolves around hate, not love. Barbie, here, hates men, capitalism, fun and hates Barbie doll herself (calling her a fascist and worse throughout the plot). Barbie also hates women who have cute memories of the doll, if you're a woman and you played with her as a kid, according to the movie, you supported patriarchy. Barbie can't just be a pretty, blonde, thin woman either, after all, that doesn't encompass the mandatory ""diversity and inclusion"" in Hollywood today. To resolve this issue, they created a universe in which everyone is Barbie (we even have a Barbie who was born a man, yes, a trans Barbie - who, by the way, is a doctor). The men in Barbieland (who cares) are there to be mistreated and ignored. Ken is just an accessory. When Barbie and Ken come into the real world, everything changes. Ken discovers patriarchy (a word spoken a dozen times throughout the plot) and likes that world. Barbie finds unbridled machismo (if Barbie were set in the 60s it would even make a little sense). Romance between Barbie and Ken? Not at all, after all that wouldn't be ""empowering"" at all. Ken even rejects the doll at one point.Ken represents the ""evil patriarchy"". Everything in this film becomes one big lecture, one big sermon (Barbie scolding workers who whistle at her; police officers harassing Barbie at the police station; a man slapping her on the butt out of the blue), that is, victim of the ""toxic"" men of the world. Barbie still has to choose between flip-flops and heels, showing that in the end there is only one choice to be made: follow feminism, that is, flip-flops. We also have the passage of the protagonist Gloria cheating on her husband (a fool, by the way), and the film shows that the betrayal was legal and she had an advantage in cheating.All male clichés are portrayed here according to the feminist view (because apparently men have had no problems in life since the beginning of time, according to the film's script). Here, the Barbies were co-opted by the brainwashing of patriarchy and used by the Kens in a kind of macho dystopia. Everything Ken likes is depicted as toxic, evil, and terrible (Stallone, Godfather, horses, Zack Snyder, etc.). Barbieland is portrayed as a perfect world for women (women have everything, men have nothing); Mattel executives are all portrayed as white, straight men and still calls this type of profile ""conservative fascist"". For the director, it is never enough to be a woman, you have to be a mother, a wife, work and still receive criticism. The unsuspecting will also believe that even today women do not have leadership positions in large companies, and that they cannot study, work and that they receive lower wages than men doing the same type of work (Yes, because apparently the ""evil businessmen"" hire men to pay higher wages when they could pay less for a woman to do the same job!!). At the end of the plot, Gloria's feminist discourse is the antidote to the brainwashing of oppressive patriarchy. Kens are beaten because they are ""d*mb"". The Barbies plan was to pretend to be submissive and then make their respective Ken jealous with another Ken, of course, after all, all men only know how to create wars, destroy everything they lay their hands on and are automatically stupid (After all, if men are stupid, why do they dominate the world according to what was propagated in the film? A basic and inexplicable plot hole here).""Barbie"" is a great satire, but when it touches on feminist issues, it gets serious and uses irony to make fun of men, since women are portrayed as being totally perfect. Sasha and Gloria are the main Latin characters here and the Barbie character is just the shell for the director to propagate her feminist ideas. Obviously, the film will have an excellent box office due to all the hype and marketing made for the film and, of course, the popularity of the Barbie doll that has been successful for generations, in addition to having many merits, especially in the technical part. The detailed, creative and extremely tasteful scenarios, especially in Barbieland, are a spectacle in themselves, in addition to the magnificent performances by Margot Robbie (charismatic and incredibly beautiful) and Ryan Gosling (hilarious as ever). The musicals, on the other hand, are horrible, poorly performed and owing a lot in that regard.""Barbie"" talks about choices and changes. In the hands of Greta Gerwig, the typical behavior of dolls and dolls, via imagination, takes on a critical form and points to many paths, visiting metalanguage, political-social relations, patriarchy and feminism, feelings (including the arrogant and insensitive posture of Barbie in front of Ken; as well as the unhealthy dependence of the doll on his girlfriend), existential crises or acceptance of one's social and gender condition. The work fulfilled the promise that we would have a product different from what could be imagined from a live-action Barbie, that is undeniable. The problem is that, in the end, Barbie doesn't even get a satisfactory answer to the simplest question of her journey of self-discovery.

Perceptive Take on the Barbie Mythos,"There's a bold and consistent current of subversive humanism that runs through this infectious 2023 satire that director Greta Gerwig manages with stylish aplomb. She and partner Noah Baumbach have taken the Barbie mythos and built a multilayered narrative around the evolving nature of female identity and empowerment within the context of male dominance and the patriarchy that has defined sexual roles since the beginning of time. However, this is neither a treatise nor a polemic. It's still primarily a fun, free-wheeling farce with Day-Glo colors and silly choreography filling up the screen with zestful energy informed by a knowing perspective. Margot Robbie is ideally cast in the title role as she epitomizes stereotypical Barbie. Ryan Gosling gives Ken the right level of disempowerment as he gets taken in by the lure of toxic masculinity. The rest of the cast appear equally game. Gerwig has truly applied a perceptive twist to a candy-coated girlhood memory.",percept take barbi mytho,there bold consist current subvers human run infecti satir director greta gerwig manag stylish aplomb she partner noah baumbach taken barbi mytho built multilay narr around evolv natur femal ident empower within context male domin patriarchi defin sexual role sinc begin time howev neither treatis polem it still primarili fun freewheel farc dayglo color silli choreographi fill screen zest energi inform know perspect margot robbi ideal cast titl role epitom stereotyp barbi ryan gosl give ken right level disempower get taken lure toxic masculin the rest cast appear equal game gerwig truli appli percept twist candyco girlhood memori
I'll beach you off so hard,"I had no idea what to expect going into Barbie. I had no interest in seeing a movie about Barbie but was immediately sold on the highly talented Margot Robbie and the awesome Ryan Gosling. But I was still nervous that the comedy would be aimed strictly at women and would be difficult for a guy to enjoy.To my surprise, I didn't feel that at all. This movie is hilarious. It's the kind of stupid-funny I love, the kind usually reserved for ""dude movies."" Something you're more likely to see in a Will Ferrell movie. I was not aware Ryan Gosling could be so funny.Even though the majority of the movie is silly and fun, Margot Robbie still gives a great performance, as usual. She continues to prove she's a star. And most of the supporting cast are welcomed additions.I found Barbie highly entertaining. I think most will enjoy it, except maybe guys who are sensitive to anything empowering women or making fun of men. That's not me.

A beautiful Barbie movie in 2023!!!,"Wow!!! Barbie really brought my attention in the cinemas! It made me laugh and cry at the same time. I was literally enjoying the best moments in the film, and it really is a beautiful movie, and Barbie was made for kids, but there are also not meant for kids.Margot Robbie is brilliant for this role as Barbie, and she's the right girl for the job to portray the character, and her performance was so beautiful, and Ryan Gosling steals the show! Barbie promises one thing, and that one thing that it promises to be, is a personification, of a Barbie doll that little girls have been playing with sense she was made 80 years ago.The movie also learns about female experience, it's also about feminism, and men needs to understand how woman feel, and truly needs to know how they feel. And I gotta say, this movie learns so well, and tells a very good story, and how well it performs in the movie.Greta Gerwig did a fabulous job directing, and making this movie, and she earns the spotlight in filmmaking history, along with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling and the rest of the Cast and Crew!If you like Barbie, or if you don't like Barbie, then this is the movie for you to watch in the cinemas!10/10.",a beauti barbi movi,wow barbi realli brought attent cinema it made laugh cri time i liter enjoy best moment film realli beauti movi barbi made kid also meant kidsmargot robbi brilliant role barbi she right girl job portray charact perform beauti ryan gosl steal show barbi promis one thing one thing promis personif barbi doll littl girl play sen made year agoth movi also learn femal experi also femin men need understand woman feel truli need know feel and i got ta say movi learn well tell good stori well perform moviegreta gerwig fabul job direct make movi earn spotlight filmmak histori along margot robbi ryan gosl rest cast crewif like barbi dont like barbi movi watch cinema
Great if not ham-fisted message but a sloppy movie.,"I was pretty excited to see this film and hope I'm not going to get put on a list for saying I didn't enjoy it that much. The message of female empowerment was fine, but didn't really speak to gender equality. Barbieland is the opposite of real world where Barbies are in control and kens are perceived as the mindless accessories. However, the ending just puts Barbies back on top and doesn't do much to equality which I hope is our goal. The movie itself was very sloppy and all finish with no build up. You could tell the writers had ideas of what they wanted to have happen but had zero clue how to get there. They wanted Ken to take the patriarchy back to Barbieland but this happens immediately and off screen despite the Kens being bumbling morons the entire movie. It's all payoff and no buildup. Good acting from a strong cast made this more fun to watch but when you start thinking a little deeper it didn't make much sense. I think this was a made for tik tok movie where there's 100 great scenes to throw up on the internet but not very cohesive when put together.",great hamfist messag sloppi movi,i pretti excit see film hope im go get put list say i didnt enjoy much the messag femal empower fine didnt realli speak gender equal barbieland opposit real world barbi control ken perceiv mindless accessori howev end put barbi back top doesnt much equal i hope goal the movi sloppi finish build you could tell writer idea want happen zero clue get they want ken take patriarchi back barbieland happen immedi screen despit ken bumbl moron entir movi it payoff buildup good act strong cast made fun watch start think littl deeper didnt make much sen i think made tik tok movi there great scene throw internet cohes put togeth
OPP - Eve and Adam,"No pun intended - OPP as in other peoples .... patriarchy! What did you think the last p stood for? Naughty (by nature) are we? Kidding aside, I know that song too and I chose it ... well I would say wisely. Not sure if you think I am hammering anything home here ... I can tell you the movie is! And it did make quite a few people angry - now I understand that one should not count the times you hear the word patriarchy ... won't bode well for you. Also it is quite a lot.But let's get back to the beginning. Why would a grown man even watch a Barbie movie? Well why not? Especially when it begins with one of the best homages to Kubricks 2001 (and Greta has learned quite a bit during her filmmaking career). That said, that completely insane beginning sets a tone - and there is a lot of weird stuff going off here (I think I would be good at beach offs - what do you mean it has nothing to do with the sea and the sand and the ... ohh ... I see)! But that is the point - actually there could have been way more weird stuff - I would have loved it.That said, we do get great actors here - and they all have the same (character) name. Well almost - as easy as it is to remember their names (Ken and Barbie ... sorry Barbie and Ken obviously, lest we forget the star of the movie), is the message of the movie! But and that is what I liked about it more than the almost overbearing message: there is more to discover! You are not or rather you do not have to be what others expect you to be! You are not defined by your significant other (no matter your gender).So while Ken may feel he is nothing without Barbie - well he may go off and do stuff he shouldn't be doing. Like ... (insert a joke about the main point the movie is making and then me explaining something you already know) ... but is it worth it getting hung up on that? Or is it rather better to just enjoy the movie and empower those who never had a voice? Yes a lot of cliches are being thrown around - and the fact many have declared war on ... the movie for no particular reason, makes this even sweeter! They are not even the target audience.There are silly jokes (some aimed at a more grown up audience, like the beach off one), there are references to the doll itself - and there is a lot of comparison. Since this had the green light from Mattel itself it may have to include certain things that are here to shine a good light on them too. Still they don't mind being poked at too (entire board being male for example, a specific doll and much more).Costume and set design is exactly what you would expect - I did not realize the massive budget this had (googled it because a friend mentioned it) .. but it made that money back boxoffice wise and then some.Will Ferrell being the icing on the cake (even if he is unable to catch anything ... even when its right in front of him ... and taking the longest time to get to a beach ... well for obvious timing reasons and very considerate if you think of it) ... a cake that might be pink after all ... hey it once was a color men prefered ... so who knows, things may change one day ... right?

Pinkland,"This movie is an excellent marketing product. Cinemas were full, Even in Baku city. It was very difficult to find tickets. People dressed in pink clothes were coming to this event. I wore my black shirt and went. I think the movie was not good. I fell asleep in some scenes. There were lots of boring speeches. The movie was fun, that's obvious, but I didn't laugh much. This movie became one of the most different and crazy events of our day. I don't think it has any value as a movie. It was indeed a bad movie, but as an event it was fun. I don't regret. There were some references. I liked most of them. The acting wasn't bad, I think it was good. I was getting bored again near the end of the movie.

Not for me.,"Barbie (Margot Robbie) travels from Barbieland to the real world where she learns to her surprise that men are in control...I'm not a fan of this Barbie movie - regardless of whether I agree with its feminist message about the patriarchy or not, I just didn't find it funny and I didn't find it enjoyable. The humour was lame, I thought that the performances were weak (am I the only person who isn't a Margot Robbie fan?), and the songs were beyond awful.About the only thing that I can commend about the film is its production design, but even that got on my nerves from time to time (the travelling to the real world from Barbieland on cardboard cut-outs -- sheesh!). Obviously, I'm in the minority for not liking this film, because it has a high rating and has made a mint at the box office, but I guess we can't all like the same things.",not,barbi margot robbi travel barbieland real world learn surpris men controlim fan barbi movi regardless whether i agre feminist messag patriarchi i didnt find funni i didnt find enjoy the humour lame i thought perform weak i person isnt margot robbi fan song beyond awfulabout thing i commend film product design even got nerv time time travel real world barbieland cardboard cutout sheesh obvious im minor like film high rate made mint box offic i guess cant like thing

An enjoyable fun filled fantasy,"Director Greta Gerwig takes us on a fun ride in the life of stereotypical Barbie ( Margot Robbie) as she navigates through various aspects of her life. She is joined by Ken ( Ryan Gosling) in this fantasy of pink decor, colourful costumes and the kitsch sets in a dream like atmosphere . The movie has exquisite cinematography ,melodious songs and attractive dances. There is an innocent quirkiness in the characters and the intermittent light humour keeps one amused. There is fun and fantasy all the way in all colourful scenes. The rainbows in the background add to the beauty. The cinematography has carefully framed fabulous visuals which will appeal to all audiences. The highlight of course is the superb acting of Margot Robbie who excells in exuding the innocent charm of the much loved character. She is definitely a refined artist who gets under the skin of the character. Ryan Gosling also does well as Ken showing his versatility. His one liners are said with his typical charm which will please his fans. The special effects help to create the dream like ambience and are pleasing to watch. I forsee the movie getting nominated for best actress ( Margot Robbie ) and for production design, costume design , make up and cinematography.",an enjoy fun fill fantasi,director greta gerwig take u fun ride life stereotyp barbi margot robbi navig variou aspect life she join ken ryan gosl fantasi pink decor colour costum kitsch set dream like atmospher the movi exquisit cinematographi melodi song attract danc there innoc quirki charact intermitt light humour keep one amus there fun fantasi way colour scene the rainbow background add beauti the cinematographi care frame fabul visual appeal audienc the highlight cours superb act margot robbi excel exud innoc charm much love charact she definit refin artist get skin charact ryan gosl also well ken show versatil hi one liner said typic charm plea fan the special effect help creat dream like ambienc plea watch i forse movi get nomin best actress margot robbi product design costum design make cinematographi
Barbie - Unspeakably Bad,"I am not surprised in the least that the Barbie movie is trash and a truly deplorable career choice by Margot Robbie who will probably be type cast forever in Barbie-type roles.To begin with, there is just too much pink and superficiality for this movie to inspire anything more than groans and watching your watch waiting for the whole travesty to be over. The plot is completely by the numbers as Barbie has the perfect life in Barbie World. Then suddenly she yearns to see the ""real world."" Where did we see that storyline before? Let's see... I know... The Little Mermaid and a hundred other movies ripping off the same plot.But if that's not bad enough, we have to sit through dreary dialogue such as Ken wanting to sleep over with Barbie while being totally innocent of sex and the fairy god mother pressuring Barbie to reject the high heels in order to seek enlightenment, as if Barbie should not make the choice on her own without somebody prodding her in a particular direction.Even the people who like it can't point to anything original in it. Where that 77% comes from is beyond me.",barbi unspeak bad,i surpris least barbi movi trash truli deplor career choic margot robbi probabl type cast forev barbietyp rolesto begin much pink superfici movi inspir anyth groan watch watch wait whole travesti the plot complet number barbi perfect life barbi world then suddenli yearn see real world where see storylin let see i know the littl mermaid hundr movi rip plotbut that bad enough sit dreari dialogu ken want sleep barbi total innoc sex fairi god mother pressur barbi reject high heel order seek enlighten barbi make choic without somebodi prod particular directioneven peopl like cant point anyth origin where come beyond
Barbie Fantastic!,"The acting was amazing. Ryan Gosling should win an award for this. There was much laughter, tears, dancing, and conflict which all played out well. The acting resembled the characters as toys, down to every little detail. Phenomenal acting! The movie shows that Barbie and Ken, and the other characters have been completely thought out. The development was very deep and relates to the audience very well. The dialogue was great, too, as there was just enough of it, showing depth. Ties into the plot and theme thoroughly.Barbie has impacted girls for many years and the movie introduces the audience to a light hearted history of it. Barbie is supposed to be perfect and experience every day at its best. But the world of Barbie the audience sees is far from perfect, and it is separated from the real world of those who actually play with her. The plot development was amazing, as Barbie goes on a mission to discover herself and save her Barbie world. In the meantime like the slogan says, ""She's everything. He's just Ken."" Ken is also having a crisis in being number two, and questions how he fits into the Barbie world. As both toys deal with their identity crises, the themes of empowerment, patriarchy, feminism, and being yourself comes into play. Other valuable life lessons are shown as well that makes this movie memorable for women and even men. The themes are powerful and heartwarming, yet raw and honest. The sound was bubbly and popping, the graphics impressed me the most. From the costumes, to the plasticity of objects, to the action everything was visually effective. The camera angles were also notable.This movie was very upbeat and much more hilarious than I orginally anticipated. The movie resonates with what its like as they tackle the real world. The movie brings so many elements from various generations of Barbie and the audience learns about the creator and what it means to be-Barbie. As she and Ken both question their existence, the heart of the movie centers on the impact that they make towards themselves and others. With fantastic graphics, dancing and song, humor, and life lessons this movie makes it a captivating film that everyone will surely enjoy!",barbi fantast,the act amaz ryan gosl win award there much laughter tear danc conflict play well the act resembl charact toy everi littl detail phenomen act the movi show barbi ken charact complet thought the develop deep relat audienc well the dialogu great enough show depth tie plot theme thoroughlybarbi impact girl mani year movi introduc audienc light heart histori barbi suppos perfect experi everi day best but world barbi audienc see far perfect separ real world actual play the plot develop amaz barbi goe mission discov save barbi world in meantim like slogan say she everyth he ken ken also crisi number two question fit barbi world a toy deal ident crise theme empower patriarchi femin come play other valuabl life lesson shown well make movi memor woman even men the theme power heartwarm yet raw honest the sound bubbl pop graphic impress from costum plastic object action everyth visual effect the camera angl also notablethi movi upbeat much hilari i orgin anticip the movi reson like tackl real world the movi bring mani element variou gener barbi audienc learn creator mean bebarbi a ken question exist heart movi center impact make toward other with fantast graphic danc song humor life lesson movi make captiv film everyon sure enjoy
Barbie Land,"Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. Its good anyway.",barbi land,im realli disappoint love movi honest it kind weird strang begin understand later barbi world so play cultur refer barbi doll repres ideal world woman power thing get pretti normal enter real world problem sexual remark woman place societi inequ men i pretti sure talk problem woman complex barbi perfect woman contrast real world it pretti obviou talk i love also ken also notic men power real world like everyon see realiti realli perceiv realiti power shift also later barbi land i understand act like stuff didnt realli get movi honest identifi talk societi busi music thing choregraphi even moral kind superfici but enjoy barbi realis problem world compar some moment funni seriou drama sometim even pretti soft barbi land i mean spend great time kind ok and still think great barbi movi task easi repres world enjoy set design color camera movement it good anyway
🏩 Possibly a Masterpiece? 💒,"I Understand that Some People are Going to Have Big Big Problems with Some of the Messaging within this Film. But Sometimes, in Life 😂, You Just Have to Go With It.Hashtag NUMBER 1 Lesson You Should Take From this Film: Build, Hone, Grow, and then Come Together and Become KENOUGH! (Both Guys and Girls)Greta Gerwig Nailed this Thing!I was just sitting Their Watching it and I was like ""Man, I'm Actually Enjoying what the hell is going on here"" 🤣Things I Liked About The Film -1. Firstly, the Plotline and More Importantly, the Execution of this Plotline is Great imo. It's Interesting and Kept me Engaged from Point to Point. It hits the points it needs to hit with it's Comedic Tone and Some Serious Moments too. The Balance is Laced in and Out of the Film and is just about PERFECT. (Again, People are Going to have Problems with Certain Things)2. Secondly, the Aesthetics are so Good. It is Such a Unique Watch. You Won't See Anything Like It. What a Watch! WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE!3. The Tone 🏩 and the Way much of the Dialogue is Delivered is Fitting For this Film.4. The Cinematography and Some of the Shots at Times are So Good. It's Gorgeous.5. Margot Robbie Literally Perfects This Role as Barbie. Her Acting, Her Tone, Her Look. 🌸 Not to Mention Some of her Costuming (Pink Cowboy Outfit) 🤠 makes Her Look Out of This World.6. Ryan Gosling Nails it. He was Absolutely Hilarious at Times (Especially in the 3RD Act)7. Much of the Comedy Landed for me (Comedy is Subjective, so also, Some Didn't) and from what I Heard, it Landed for a Lot of the Audience I was with. (Beached off Wasn't Funny, but after That, The Laughs Started Coming in). (4th Wall Ugly Joke, Margot Is the Wrong Example for this, was the Biggest Laugh in the theatre 😆)8. So to Summarise, I Really Liked the Beach Battle, The Dance Scenes, the Plotline, The Comedy, the Tone, The Aesthetics and the Atmosphere in that Theatre whilst Watching this Thing.From what I watched, it was Well Put Together, Well Excecuted and everything Came Together So Well. And that Cherry on Top Quip 🍒🎂 from Margot Robbie was Just 👌Overall, if You have Problems with the Some of the Messaging, You will Not Enjoy it, Bottom Line.

Just a little empty,"I really wanted to enjoy this and I know that I am not the target audience but there were massive plot holes and no real flow. The film was very disjointed. Ryan Gosling as good as he is seemed to old to play Ken and Will Ferrell ruined every scene he was in. I just didn't get it, it seemed hollow artificial and hackneyed. A waste of some great talent. It was predictable without being reassuring and trying so hard to be woke in the most superficial way in that but trying to tick so many boxes it actually ticked none. Margo Robbie looks beautiful throughout, the costumes and the sets were amazing but the story was way too weak and didn't make much sense at all.",just littl empti,i realli want enjoy i know i target audienc massiv plot hole real flow the film disjoint ryan gosl good seem old play ken will ferrel ruin everi scene i didnt get seem hollow artifici hackney a wast great talent it predict without reassur tri hard woke superfici way tri tick mani box actual tick none margo robbi look beauti throughout costum set amaz stori way weak didnt make much sen
Mind blowing,"Barbie is simply a mind-blowing experience, and in a truly fine way! I was taken aback with the 2001 opening, since I have a personal aversion to seeing toys get destroyed, but then it starts to unfold.And what we have is a combination of The Twilight Zone and 1971's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.It really focuses in on one Barbie (Margot Robbie) who finds herself out of her element, and her struggle to comes to terms with herself. Though the film has some weirdness to it, it sets us up for the second half of the film which really shines.And its messages pack a wallop!!!The casting is top notch, starting with Ms. Robbie in the title role. Ryan Gosling also delivers a fantastic performance as well, with a wide range. But one actress truly deserves a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, and that is America Ferrara. The other performers are likewise great!I'm also struck by how Mattel allowed itself to be show in a fantasy way that isn't always flattering. And toward the end, we have the Barbie doll's creator, Ruth Handler (Rhea Perlman) tell Ms. Robbie's character some facts about herself that are less than flattering. That scene alone is incredibly powerful.And of course, the visuals are something to behold!On the whole, a truly incredible film that has a lot of originality!

Disappointed,"I didn't see Barbie in the theater (but I don't see many in the theater anymore) but I had seen glowing reviews as well as friends who had seen the film and recommended. By the time I was able to view the film I had high expectations. There were certainly extremely funny moments, but for me few and far between. Gosling was singled out by many as the best in the film and I agreed there were enough outlandish moments with his character that earned him that. But, I thought that Michael Cera's character Allan was far funnier, even though his role was more of an extended cameo. I can't deny that Margot Robbie was an exceptional Barbie but overall I was disappointed with the film. Gerwig went a bit too far with her support of women's rights (which I do support). It may have been the build up prior to seeing the movie that actually resulted in it not reaching my expectations. I've had that same issue with other films, however.",disappoint,i didnt see barbi theater i dont see mani theater anymor i seen glow review well friend seen film recommend by time i abl view film i high expect there certainli extrem funni moment far gosl singl mani best film i agre enough outlandish moment charact earn but i thought michael cera charact allan far funnier even though role extend cameo i cant deni margot robbi except barbi overal i disappoint film gerwig went bit far support woman right i support it may build prior see movi actual result reach expect ive issu film howev
I'm actually ashamed to have watched this rubbish!,"When it was announced that Barbie was to be made as a live action movie I cringed and pretty much forget about it. Then the hype erupted, and you couldn't get away from the frenzy surrounding this movie. I had to see the trailer; my intrigue got the better of me.Wow! It actually looked good! Parody, satire, an interesting premise.Now, I wasn't prepared to just take the plunge, I still had my doubts and didn't want to be paying Cinema or home premier prices. So, I waited, but remained strangely eager to enjoy this guilty pleasure and hopefully have a great laugh in the process. After all, the reviews and buzz around Barbie never seemed to die down too much.£1.99 on Prime was the clincher. I am a middle-aged man, and I persuaded my wife and teenage son to watch it with me. The Trailer sold it to them easily.Instant smiles when kids began smashing their dolls, mimicking the apes in 2001: A Space Odyssey.The next 15 minutes was sickly but set the scene and bridged to the premise teased so much in the trailers.The next hour was ok, but never really reached my expectations. It had some humorous moments, little else.The final 30 minutes was just awful! Terrible songs and relentless bashing over the head with their big message. It was insulting how the movie makers forced this down the viewers throats as if we were all completely dumb and wouldn't understand it if it wasn't repeated over and over again!It wasn't the message that ruined the movie, the message is valid and strong, I couldn't agree with it more! Sadly, the movie is largely boring and dull. This formula framed in a sickly Barbie world as it is, just doesn't convey the message well at all.Great ad campaign, and obviously the movie is appealing to some, just not to me or my family.A generous 3/10

Great philosophical film to think about and laugh about.,"This is.... Was.... Admirably!I'm absolutely delighted!I don't want to write, it's a huge review of Barbie, therefore:
""Barbie"" is a great philosophical film to think about and laugh about.I think that this tape will appeal to everyone, from collectors of Barbie dolls and those who rummage around in the Barbie universe (like me, for example) and ending with those people who do not know anything about it at all.Margot Robbie is the perfect Barbie; Ryan Gosling is silly, but chic and perfect Ken. Their tandem is gorgeous, every time they were, together; I was very pleased to see them.Also, I was very pleased to see John Cena, Dua Lipa and Kate McKinnon. They're gorgeous.The jokes in Barbie are orious, and in the finale I roared.The plot is excellent, interesting, easy and, as I wrote above, philosophical.I haven't watched Oppenheimer yet, but I already think that Barbie is a more serious film against it!The soundtrack of ""Barbie"" is wonderful; I listen to it every day now.In general, I did not notice the disadvantages of Barbie, but noticed some advantages.As a result, ""Barbie"" is an ideal, wonderful film to laugh and be sad and think.I put the tape 10 out of 10 and if you have it in cinemas, then run and watch it!IT'S WORTH WATCHING ON THE BIG SCREEN!!REVISION IN CINEMA!!Well, let me remind you for those who have forgotten or for those who have not read my last review of «Barbie» that in July of this year I watched it in a soapy but normal screen.After watching it, I was delighted and decided that I had to go to the cinema and watch this film again.And finally, today (September 9), the unofficial show of «Barbie» officially began, and just today I went to it!Even the price of 500 rubles did not stop me, because when I watched the screen, I understood that it is better to see such a movie on the big screen!In short, my opinion has not changed!«Barbie» - is still a great philosophical film to think about and laugh at.I think this is the end of it, because I don't want to write the same thing as in July!I will add that I am still delighted with this film and I again give it 10 out of 10 and again I want to recommend it for viewing, especially in the cinema!Because, if you compare viewing in the cinema and in the screens, then these are completely different things and in the cinema I got even more emotions and delight from this film!P.

Expected more from Greta Gerwig,"Even though I'm not the target audience for this movie, I thought Barbie might impress me due to Greta Gerwig's previous works but I'm disappointed.The main problem is that the overall message isn't clear. This doesn't go to say that the movie is frivolous. What happens is that it gets lost trying to explore multiple meaningful topics and never reaches the punchline. It addresses relevant themes like patriarchy, sexism, gender roles, existencialism, imperfection, individuality and identity but always on a shallow level. Every scene in this script tries to convince you that it's saying something profound when in reality it sacrifices depth and character development in favor of cheap humor, which results in an immature and non-compelling production.In contrast, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were perfectly casted and their performances are as good as the screenplay allows them to be. The production and costume design from Barbie Land are noteworthy too.Hopefully Greta Gerwig will release other movies in the future as brilliant as Lady Bird, which I genuinely think deserves 5 stars.",expect greta gerwig,even though im target audienc movi i thought barbi might impress due greta gerwig previou work im disappointedth main problem overal messag isnt clear thi doesnt go say movi frivol what happen get lost tri explor multipl meaning topic never reach punchlin it address relev theme like patriarchi sexism gender role existenci imperfect individu ident alway shallow level everi scene script tri convinc say someth profound realiti sacrific depth charact develop favor cheap humor result immatur noncompel productionin contrast margot robbi ryan gosl perfectli cast perform good screenplay allow the product costum design barbi land noteworthi toohop greta gerwig releas movi futur brilliant ladi bird i genuin think deserv star
Great Casting: But is it Satire or Social Commentary?,"The casting for the roles is pretty well spot on. Margot Robbie is an absolute superstar and nobody would fit the role of Barbie better. I liked the little joke when Barbie says ""I'm not pretty anymore. I'm not 'stereotypical Barbie' pretty and the narrator replies "" Note to the filmmakers: Margot Robbie is the wrong person to cast if you want to make this point."" Even when they try to make Margot Robbie less pretty they can't really achieve it. Robbie shines with charisma every time she is on a screen and this movie is no exception. Not only is she very attractive but her acting is superb as well.They also found perfect roles for Ryan Gosling and Will Ferrell. The roles fit their skill sets perfectly and made the best of what is overall a pretty unusual and scattered movie. The costumes in the film were also fantastic and probably helped tap into some nostalgia with people who played with Barbie's before.The movies biggest issue in my mind was that it couldn't ever really decide what it was. This led to an inability to achieve any momentum as you aren't sure whether it's going to hit you with silly jokes that were quite funny at times or whether you were supposed to scramble through the social messaging it was also clearly trying to send. The problem is especially clear when the two blurred together. I wasn't sure whether some topics were serious social messages they are trying to advance or to simply be viewed as a joke.The ending made it all even more confusing. I don't mind endings being preachy but it was unclear what the audience is supposed to take away from what went down.Overall I would have preferred if the entire movie was one big comedy , but I suppose the filmmakers knew best since they're the ones raking in the cash right now.

"""You can be anything.""","The story in Barbie isn't about a doll. It's about reconciling the imperfect world we live in with the idealized stories we tell and create. We use our dolls, toys, and play to create those stories. We internalize the ideals shared through those stories. Sometimes they are good ideals that empower us. Sometimes they are toxic ideals that disempower us. Ultimately they are created by us and we are influenced by them.We created them, and we can change them. We can make them what ever we want them to be. We can make ourselves what ever we want to be. The tag line for the barbie doll is ""You can be anything."" That in the point of the movie.

"Fun, but too on the nose at times","POSITIVES:1) Ryan Gosling completely steals the film for me. He's hilarious, but also completely sells the emotional moments too. A great performance 2) The film had several moments that made me laugh out loud. A lot of the humour is very clever, as can be expected from these two great writers. I should also say that I think the emotional moments were written very well too, particularly Barbie and Ken's 'breakup' at the end, which I thought was the best scene in the film 3) The production design and costume design were both terrific and will probably win their respective OscarsNEGATIVES:1) There are multiple times where the film was far too goofy for me. Examples include the chase scene in the Mattel headquarters and the car chase scene that follows it 2) The message, whilst respectable in a way, was just far too on the nose for me at times. When it was done subtly it felt clever and interesting, but then when they just did big monologues at the end it just became too over the top 3) The film felt quite dated for me. If this had came out in the 90s or 2000s I feel like it would've been much more impactful and relevant, whereas nowadays not many kids play with Barbie dolls and the male-dominated society is nowhere near as prevalent.",fun nose time,posit ryan gosl complet steal film he hilari also complet sell emot moment a great perform the film sever moment made laugh loud a lot humour clever expect two great writer i also say i think emot moment written well particularli barbi ken breakup end i thought best scene film the product design costum design terrif probabl win respect oscarsneg there multipl time film far goofi exampl includ chase scene mattel headquart car chase scene follow the messag whilst respect way far nose time when done subtli felt clever interest big monologu end becam top the film felt quit date if came i feel like wouldv much impact relev wherea nowaday mani kid play barbi doll maledomin societi nowher near preval
A perfect dollhouse,"""Barbie"": Greta Gerwig's new film manages to be extremely creative and original while, at the same time, a bit generic. The film starts strong with an impeccable introduction referencing ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" and then transitions to the gigantic dollhouse that is Barbieland. The production design is simply incredible, the use of CGI is imperceptible, the practical effects are great, the costumes are unique, and the makeup and hair contribute to the excellent art direction. The performances are all good, especially those of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, who as Ken manage to steal the scenes several times. The weakest point lies in the script, which hits and misses at every moment. Its execution is good, the story itself works well, even without explaining some details. Nothing comes close to hindering the experience. Greta aims to deliver strong critiques and attempts to remain neutral, but at a specific moment, she forces it too much, causing a disconnection with the viewer. In the following scene, there's a spectacular sequence involving Ken, creating a sensation that his storyline is better. It's not; it's just more entertaining. The only ""weak"" storyline is that of the human mother-daughter duo and the executives. It's one of the weaker aspects of a good, fun, exciting, and creative film, which falls short of being even better due to stumbling over its details.",a perfect dollhous,barbi greta gerwig new film manag extrem creativ origin time bit gener the film start strong impecc introduct referenc a space odyssey transit gigant dollhous barbieland the product design simpli incred use cgi impercept practic effect great costum uniqu makeup hair contribut excel art direct the perform good especi margot robbi ryan gosl ken manag steal scene sever time the weakest point lie script hit miss everi moment it execut good stori work well even without explain detail noth come close hinder experi greta aim deliv strong critiqu attempt remain neutral specif moment forc much caus disconnect viewer in follow scene there spectacular sequenc involv ken creat sensat storylin better it entertain the weak storylin human motherdaught duo execut it one weaker aspect good fun excit creativ film fall short even better due stumbl detail
It was good but far too preachy,"I really enjoyed the movie. The acting was amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was amazing. I just thought it was too on the nose. Like the message was literally forced in your face. It seemed lazy to me. I went in thinking it was going to be similar to The Truman Show and I wished it had've taken some elements from it because it would've made it much more powerful if so. I'm not going to spoil the ending but I thought the writers just gave up. Overall for me it's a 6/10. Good film but that's all. Definitely could've been less preachy. Ultimately, it's nice movie to see and I'd see it again at some point but it wasn't great.",it good far preachi,i realli enjoy movi the act amaz margot robbi ryan gosl amaz i thought nose like messag liter forc face it seem lazi i went think go similar the truman show i wish hadv taken element wouldv made much power im go spoil end i thought writer gave overal good film that definit couldv le preachi ultim nice movi see id see point wasnt great

A soundtrack that will take you from laughing to crying (yes, very musical moments, after all it is a Barbie movie), in addition to the hand-picked cast, Margot is impeccable and manages to express all her feelings, just with her eyes.

They made it very fun and entertaining and I truly laughed out loud at a few jokes. I also really appreciated the message, though a bit on the nose at times. While the plot, directing, and production value are good, it really is the cast that is selling this movie and I applaud all of them, supporting characters included.

Not written well enough,"I thought the storyline of this movie was not well structured. The first act was mostly fun with some genuine humor. We see Barbie living in a world that looks like the toys brought to life. When she decides to go to the ""real world,"" it disrupts life for the residents of toyland. We also learn that many girls resent Barbie dolls because of the unrealistic expectations they set for females. Then, the conflict shifts completely to the male dolls taking over the Barbie world and treating the women poorly. So now there are two competing storylines, and as the characters work to resolve both issues, we get repetitive monologues about finding oneself. It gets very muddled and isn't much fun at this point. I thought they should have kept it simple, because they seemed to be on the right track early on.",not written well enough,i thought storylin movi well structur the first act mostli fun genuin humor we see barbi live world look like toy brought life when decid go real world disrupt life resid toyland we also learn mani girl resent barbi doll unrealist expect set femal then conflict shift complet male doll take barbi world treat woman poorli so two compet storylin charact work resolv issu get repetit monologu find oneself it get muddl isnt much fun point i thought kept simpl seem right track earli
Everyone watch this,"BarbieDid you grow up playing with Barbie's? If so, you probably know that not everyone likes the idea of Barbie. Some people think Barbie's are harmful to children. Other people love Barbie. This new movie called, Barbie, explores why Barbie could be problematic. Greta Gerwig is the director, previously she directed Little Women. It stars Margot Robbie from Birds of Prey and Suicide Squad, Ryan Gosling from The Notebook and La La Land, Michael Cera from Arrested Development, Helen Mirren, and Rhea Perlman.In 1959, Ruth Handler, the co-founder of the Mattel toy company, created Barbie. She wanted this doll to inspire little girls to dream and know they can be whatever they want. This thought process seems sexist, it leaves out little boys, who also can be whatever they want. The movie will show you that Handler's idea that Barbie will make society better, hasn't worked out as she probably wanted. Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan Gosling) live in Barbie land, where women are in charge. Barbie needs to travel to the real world, where she discovers men are in charge and she isn't the inspiration she thought she was.Robbie plays two sides of the same character, at first Barbie is very carefree in Barbie land, and oblivious to all societies' problems. When she gets to the real world however, she discovers things seem to be the opposite from where she came from. Not only is Gosling nice to look at but he also will make the audience laugh. Ken has always felt left out of Barbie land, until he travels to the real world with Barbie. Unfortunately, he learns the wrong lesson from capitalism. He finds out men are in charge, and wants that for Barbie land. What his take away should have been however, is that men and women can both hold equal power. Alan (Michael Cera) doesn't have a duplicate, therefore he knew who he was from the beginning. He has good morals and values, which gives him confidence to be the best version of himself. Meanwhile, Ken and Barbie are struggling to figure out who they are, and want to be.The dancing, choreography, and facial expressions were all done spectacularly well. The cast, including the supporting characters did a wonderful job. Gosling does an excellent job, portraying a more submissive Ken in the beginning, then more dominant, when he wants to take charge of Barbie land. Robbie's role as Barbie was much different than when she played Harley Quinn. Barbie is nice, kind, and not evil, while Harley Quinn is a criminal, who could be good from time to time. These roles show she is good at playing different parts, which will help her in the future.Not only does this movie have some funny moments, but it also has themes that are relevant to what's happening in life today. Capitalism, equality for all, female empowerment, and self-acceptance, are all things people need to know about.There is a lot of pressure on women to be perfect. Women have to go to work, which usually means getting payed less than men, taking care of the house and kids, all while looking their best, which is difficult to do all the time. Mattel hoped that Barbie would be an inspiration for women. Unfortunately, she doesn't even look like most people, Barbie is extremely skinny, which is an unrealistic standard for anyone to live up to. Along with that, the company, Mattel, and its founders aren't exactly honest people. Years after Barbie was made, Handler was found guilty of tax evasion.Barbie shows one of the reasons the WGA (Writers Guild of America) and SAG (Screen Actors Guild) are striking. They all want better pay, meanwhile the top CEO's of company's make millions a year. However, the way it should be is more equal, meet somewhere in the middle. Don't pay people so little they need multiple jobs to support their family, but also no one is asking to become a millionaire. Barbie is a good movie that happened to come out at the perfect time. I would encourage everyone to go see this movie. It was well cast and has multiple messages surrounding issues our society faces today.",everyon watch,barbiedid grow play barbi if probabl know everyon like idea barbi some peopl think barbi harm child other peopl love barbi thi new movi call barbi explor barbi could problemat greta gerwig director previous direct littl woman it star margot robbi bird prey suicid squad ryan gosl the notebook la la land michael cera arrest develop helen mirren rhea perlmanin ruth handler cofound mattel toy compani creat barbi she want doll inspir littl girl dream know whatev want thi thought process seem sexist leav littl boy also whatev want the movi show handler idea barbi make societi better hasnt work probabl want barbi margot robbi ken ryan gosl live barbi land woman charg barbi need travel real world discov men charg isnt inspir thought wasrobbi play two side charact first barbi carefre barbi land oblivi societi problem when get real world howev discov thing seem opposit came not gosl nice look also make audienc laugh ken alway felt left barbi land travel real world barbi unfortun learn wrong lesson capit he find men charg want barbi land what take away howev men woman hold equal power alan michael cera doesnt duplic therefor knew begin he good moral valu give confid best version meanwhil ken barbi struggl figur want beth danc choreographi facial express done spectacularli well the cast includ support charact wonder job gosl excel job portray submiss ken begin domin want take charg barbi land robbi role barbi much differ play harley quinn barbi nice kind evil harley quinn crimin could good time time these role show good play differ part help futurenot movi funni moment also theme relev what happen life today capit equal femal empower selfaccept thing peopl need know aboutther lot pressur woman perfect woman go work usual mean get pay le men take care hous kid look best difficult time mattel hope barbi would inspir woman unfortun doesnt even look like peopl barbi extrem skinni unrealist standard anyon live along compani mattel founder arent exactli honest peopl year barbi made handler found guilti tax evasionbarbi show one reason wga writer guild america sag screen actor guild strike they want better pay meanwhil top ceo compani make million year howev way equal meet somewher middl dont pay peopl littl need multipl job support famili also one ask becom millionair barbi good movi happen come perfect time i would encourag everyon go see movi it well cast multipl messag surround issu societi face today
Kenchanting Kentertainment,"Based purely on having come out of one film and planning to see whatever fit in next, I went to see ""Barbie"" this weekend. There was much I enjoyed about it, but I'd have loved to have know less about it heading in.Having previously lived a joyous and perfect life in Barbieworld, stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) starts to have intrusive thoughts about her own mortality, she discovers cellulite on her legs and her feet go flat. Having visited weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) who explains that to cure these issues, she must travel to the real world and bond with her owner. Ken (Ryan Gosling) only experiences his worth when he's seen by Barbie and, whilst not invited, accompanies her on her adventure. Whilst Barbie learns that her assumptions about Barbie's positive effect on the real world aren't at all accurate, Ken discovers a concept that can revolutionise his life, the patriarchy.I am far from the first person to comment that ""Barbie"" is much cleverer, grown up and subversive than it might have been expected to have been, in the hands of other film makers. Gerwig though, constructed a tale that manages to be a love letter to Mattel's iconic character, an honest appraisal of the same characters legacy, a treatise of the position of women in the world, a considered look at male relationships and funny comedy at the same time. It set design and cinematography are great, as are the performances from a surprisingly Anglo-centric cast.Why haven't I scored it even higher then? Mostly it's my fault, the film has been so dissected and meme-field on Twitter that, even though I wasn't actively looking for it, I knew many of the beats and surprises before I saw the film. I thought that perhaps the films songs could have been a touch better, I know people like them, but I can't really remember any of them just a couple of days later.I'm annoyed, but not surprised that the lesson Hollywood seems to have immediately taken from this is not, lets let interesting and varied filmmakers have carte blanche to turn properties into interesting films, but instead it's ""movies about toys!"". I'm bracing for the wall of garbage to come, but I hope we don't forget that, as with ""The Lego Movie"" you can have a real success with a property if you believe in the creative teams.",kenchant kentertain,base pure come one film plan see whatev fit next i went see barbi weekend there much i enjoy id love know le head inhav previous live joyou perfect life barbieworld stereotyp barbi margot robbi start intrus thought mortal discov cellulit leg foot go flat have visit weird barbi kate mckinnon explain cure issu must travel real world bond owner ken ryan gosl experi worth he seen barbi whilst invit accompani adventur whilst barbi learn assumpt barbi posit effect real world arent accur ken discov concept revolutionis life patriarchyi far first person comment barbi much clever grown subvers might expect hand film maker gerwig though construct tale manag love letter mattel icon charact honest apprais charact legaci treatis posit woman world consid look male relationship funni comedi time it set design cinematographi great perform surprisingli anglocentr castwhi havent i score even higher mostli fault film dissect memefield twitter even though i wasnt activ look i knew mani beat surpris i saw film i thought perhap film song could touch better i know peopl like i cant realli rememb coupl day laterim annoy surpris lesson hollywood seem immedi taken let let interest vari filmmak cart blanch turn properti interest film instead movi toy im brace wall garbag come i hope dont forget the lego movi real success properti believ creativ team
I Was Bored Senseless!,"BarbieWhat a confusing mess, firstly to be a comedy it must pass the minimum bar of 6 out loud laughs per movie, I laughed twice. The humour employed was largely slapstick and situational irony, it had roughly the same feel as the surreality of a Wes Anderson movie, but without his touch.The whole thing lacked a strong story and any sort of narrative impetus. It really was very tedious, with much the same scene content played over and over again.The styling was good as was some of the dance routines and stylised doll movements from the cast, but even this got tiresome.The cast tried their best with the material, but to my mind Margot Robbie has done two duff movies in a row, this and Babylon. I am being to think she lacks good judgement and any acting heft.In terms of other reviewers on here, they were watching a different movie and judging the vague thematic material as a plus because it looked at the power dynamic between men and women, forgetting the exploration undertaken in this movie was a historical perspective from the 1960's, when Barbie was invented and really had little application in 2023.In summation it was style over substance, it lacked humour and story and indeed anything memorable.

"Funny, Visually Stunning, Emotional, & Engaging!","This movie made me so proud to be a woman and really appreciate the human experience! It's amazing that a film centered around a toy managed to shed light on the genuine highs and lows of being human, making it a refreshing watch! It was funny, visually stunning, emotionally resonant and engaging. I'm not sure why some have labeled it as ""preachy"" or ""agenda-driven,"" because it merely highlighted the realities faced by women today. If these aspects were challenging to watch, that might have been the film's intent - to resonate with its target audience. I appreciate that the movie reminds us what Barbie's original purpose was, to empower girls around the world! So to everyone who feels that this movie was a personal attack, it might be best for you to stop over analyzing every little thing because you weren't the target audience anyway.

Perfect for what they are expected to be. Both the main Barbie and Ken are excellently portrayed.There is a feminist overtone, but there is no lack of irony and mockery of both sexes. No one is asking you to be moved or to change your political or other persuasion. Just relax and enjoy it as a comedy.The people who criticize this movie for political or macho reasons are way out of bounds and are too easily swayed by today's political environment.

Barbie,"The first Barbie fashion doll was released by Mattel in 1954, there have been several straight-to-DVD computer-animated cartoons, but it has taken 64 for a live-action movie to be made. This was one of the most hyped-up movies of the year, I certainly couldn't ignore it, directed by Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women). Basically, the film opens with the Narrator (Dame Helen Mirren) explaining the history of dolls before the introduction of Barbie (a parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey) and how Barbie came to change the world. Barbieland is a matriarchal society where all ranges of living Barbie and Ken dolls reside. All the women are self-confident, self-sufficient, and successful, while the men spend their days engaging in recreational activities at the beach. All Barbies hold all important job positions such as doctors, lawyers, journalists, pilots, astronauts, and politicians. ""Stereotypical"" Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives her best life all day every day, while her on-off boyfriend Ken (Ryan Gosling) is only happy when he is with her, and she shows him some attention. Ken seeks a closer relationship, but Barbie rebuffs him to be independent and continue her female friendships. Barbie holds one of her regular parties at her Dreamhouse, which momentarily halts when she asks a question about mortality. The following day, Barbie finds her regular routine has altered, her raised feet have gone flat and she has cellulite. Her friends, including Writer Barbie (Alexandra Shipp), Physicist Barbie (Emma Mackey) and Lawyer Barbie (Sharon Rooney) tell her to visit Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a wise but disfigured outcast who was played with badly, giving her permanent splits and felt-tip pen drawn on her face. Weird Barbie tells her to cure her affliction, she must go to the real world and find the child playing with her. Weird Barbie does offer her the option to take her heal shoe and everything will return to normal but really wants her to take the second option (a parody of The Matrix). Driving her pink convertible outside of Barbieland, Barbie finds Ken stowed away, he insists he is coming with her, and she reluctantly agrees. Barbie and Ken travel by car, by boat, by rocket, by bicycle, by campervan, and by snowmobile (all deliberate cut-out scenarios), until they arrive at Venice Beach, Los Angeles, California. The two cause a stir while exploring, including with their colourful roller-skating gear and blades, then changing into cowboy outfits. At toy manufacturer Mattel, the creators of Barbie, the all-male board members are informed that Barbie has entered the real world. The CEO (Will Ferrell) orders her to be captured and brought to them to be put back in her box. At the local school, Barbie encounters a tween girl named Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) who criticises Barbie dolls for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards and attitudes about women. Meanwhile, Ken explores the city and learns about the patriarchal system, mistakenly believing it was all started by men and horses. It is through simple interactions with people that he feels respected and accepted for the first time; with everything he has learned he returns to Barbieland. Feeling distraught by Sasha's comments, Barbie soon meets Sasha's mother Gloria (Ugly Betty's America Ferrera), a Mattel employee, who is the person who was playing with her. Gloria is the catalyst of her existential crisis; she was playing with Sasha's old Barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to Barbie. Soon, Mattel agents arrive and take Barbie to headquarters. They attempt to put Barbie in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with Gloria and Sasha's help. During the pursuit, Barbie enters a room containing a 1950s home scenario and encounters an elderly lady (Rhea Perlman) who recognises her. Returning to Barbieland, they discover that it has changed dramatically. The Kens have taken over, while Barbies have been reduced to submissive roles, such as maids, housewives, and agreeable girlfriends. Barbie tries to convince Ken and the Barbies to return to the way things were, only to be rebuffed. Barbie becomes depressed and returns to Weird Barbie and her group of discontinued dolls. Gloria gives an inspirational speech about society's conflicting expectations of women, and Barbie's self-confidence is restored. Meanwhile, the CEO and board members are making their way to Barbieland. With the assistance of Sasha, Weird Barbie, Ken's friend Allan (Michael Cera), a lone and discontinued character, and other discontinued dolls, Gloria repeats her moving words to all Barbies to snap them out of their subordinate behaviours. Ken intends to cement the changes to Barbieland and create male superiority by changing the constitution, allowing men to become President and replace all other roles taken by the women. The restored Barbies manipulate the Kens to fight against each other to distract them from the alterations. The Barbies regain their positions of power but also realise the errors of Barbieland's previous societal system. They decide to make changes, including better treatment for the Kens and all outcast dolls. Barbie and Ken apologise to each other and acknowledge their failings. Ken feels that he has no identity or purpose without Barbie, she encourages him to find himself. Barbie remains unsure of her own purpose and identity. She suddenly finds herself in a heavenly place where she encounters the elderly lady again, revealing herself to be the spirit of Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler. Ruth explains that she created Barbie as a toy that represented what girls ""wanted to be""; she named ""Barbie"" after her daughter Barbara. After a montage of home footage of young girls playing, Ruth explains that Barbie's story has no set ending. After the Barbies, Kens, and Mattel executives bid Barbie goodbye, she decides to become human and return to the real world. Sometime later, Gloria, her husband (Ryan Piers Williams), and Sasha take Barbie, now going by the name ""Barbara Handler"", to a building for an appointment, and she enters asking to see her gynaecologist. Also starring Issa Rae as President Barbie, Hari Nef as Dr. Barbie, Shang-Chi's Simu Liu as Tourist Ken, Kingsley Ben-Adir as Basketball Ken, Sex Education's Ncuti Gatwa as Artist Ken, Jamie Demetriou as Mattel CFO, Scott Evans as Stereotypical Ken, Ana Cruz Kayne as Judge Barbie, Ritu Arya as Journalist Barbie, Derry Girls' Nicola Coughlan as Diplomat Barbie, Dua Lipa as the Mermaid Barbies, John Cena as Ken Merman, Asim Chaudhry as Warehouse Employee, Ray Fearon as Dan at the FBI, Erica Ford as Skipper, Emerald Fennell as Midge, Lucy Boynton as Proust Barbie, Rob Brydon as Sugar Daddy Ken, and costume designer Ann Roth as the Woman on the Bench. Robbie is gorgeous and perfectly cast as the loveable ""stereotypical"" Barbie going on an adventure, Gosling as the muscly, foolish, attention-seeking Ken is splendid, McKinnon is hilarious as the mangled Weird Barbie, Ferrera is good support, Ferrell is amusing, many other supporting cast members and the cameo performers are terrific, and the voice of Mirren (occasionally breaking the fourth wall) is great. Gerwig and her co-writer/real-life partner Noah Baumbach (Frances Ha, Marriage Story) were given full creative freedom for the script. They are unafraid to poke fun at the Barbie world, including many references to discontinued lines and how kids play with the toys, and interesting ideas of feminism, body image, female empowerment, the battle of the sexes, and the human experience. The visuals are sugar-coated and saturated with colour, pink obviously most prominent, with impressive set and costume design, and the soundtrack of catchy pop songs (""Pink"" by Lizzo, ""Dance the Night"" by Dua Lipa) (the original ""Barbie Girl"" by Aqua does not feature?!, there is the new version by Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice with Aqua) and fun song and dance routines. It could have been a conventional girly Barbie film with a dull love story or something and a happy ending, but it goes the other direction and benefits completely with its deliberately surreal and cheesy approach, a bonkers but inventive and worthwhile fantasy comedy.

Fun enough to like it but easily to hate for its message,": I feel confused about this movie, probably like a lot of people, on one hand I laughed as I hadnt with a movie in a long time and the vibe this movie has is just very appealing, but on the other hand while not being an anti-men movie and actually trying to have a deep message, it feels at some parts like a tantrum. The way it handles its feminist message is not the best, because while it tries to give a meaningful speach, it almost boarders with hate speach and ridiculization, I say almost, because a lot of this situations are just played by the laughs and when theyre not, while being bad, theyre not terrible. But this makes it sound like a bad movie, which barbie is not, at the end it manages to actually give a meaningfull speech about the wrong in the real world and takes some minutes to understand both sides. It is still not the best ending possible because it can be a little too ridiculous, when you have a movie thats like that all the time I dont think it matters all that much. And at the end of the day I took home with me the minutes of laughter this movie gave to me, an enjoying fun time that is worth watching.",fun enough like easili hate messag,i feel confus movi probabl like lot peopl one hand i laugh i hadnt movi long time vibe movi appeal hand antimen movi actual tri deep messag feel part like tantrum the way handl feminist messag best tri give meaning speach almost boarder hate speach ridicul i say almost lot situat play laugh theyr bad theyr terribl but make sound like bad movi barbi end manag actual give meaningful speech wrong real world take minut understand side it still best end possibl littl ridicul movi that like time i dont think matter much and end day i took home minut laughter movi gave enjoy fun time worth watch
Great acting but why this movie?,"I was really surprised about how much i liked Ryan Gosling in this. I had totally forgot about his comedic talent and timing. The movie works. There is definitely a moral message in this, even though I believe the majority of viewers will be too distracted by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslings great performances and all of the comedy elements in this and the fact that the script is hardly worth being filmed. I feel like with a different script they could have created something truly great.Over all it's a fun family movie to enjoy together. I watched this and afterwards Oppenheimer last night and I am truly glad I did it in that order, because I doubt that I would have been able to enjoy this even nearly as much if I had watched Oppenheimer first.",great act movi,i realli surpris much like ryan gosl i total forgot comed talent time the movi work there definit moral messag even though i believ major viewer distract margot robbi ryan gosl great perform comedi element fact script hardli worth film i feel like differ script could creat someth truli greatov fun famili movi enjoy togeth i watch afterward oppenheim last night i truli glad i order i doubt i would abl enjoy even nearli much i watch oppenheim first
Way too preachy,"My wife and I did the double feature of Barbie and Oppenheimer. Barbie started off strong and Ryan Gosling is very funny in the movie. The problem is none of the Barbies are in a comedy. This movie should have been 90 minutes of comedy. It maybe could have had a simple heartfelt moment between a mom and her daughter but this movie has several preachy moments that made me wonder, who is this movie for? Little girls won't enjoy this, teenage girls won't enjoy this, adult women won't enjoy this. So who is the target audience? Who are the preachy moments for?

Who'd Have Thought It?,"Who'd have thought that you could make a film about the Barbie doll. Well Greta Gerwig obviously did and what a rip-snorting entertaining piece of colourful fun it is. And on so many different levels too: socio-political commentary, gender roles, off-the-wall mayhem to mention three. There are homages to classic films from the very start that had me rolling with laughter, and it never let up.In some ways I was reminded of Yellow Submarine seasoned with a strong dose of Legally Blonde.If there was anything that dragged it was the ending. So many excellent films barrel along with one plot twist or other surprise after another (Barbie certainly does) and then there's the question of how to tie up the loose ends and provide a believable ending, and in context too. Barbie just about manages it, if a bit hokey. But then there's the final scene.

Lots of plastic but not fantastic,"Plagued by strange un-Barbie-like thoughts, Barbie (Margot Robbie) leaves 'Barbielend' for the 'Realworld' (along with tag-along Ken (Ryan Gosling)) where she (as a doll) has been rejected by a child, only to discover that the male-dominated Realworld is not to her tastes. The film has some fun moments (especially in the first third) and fabulous imagery but the social-messaging was a bit heavy-handed and I quickly lost interest in the story, especially during the interminable and unmemorable song-and dance numbers. Anyone interested in a parody of 'Mattel's Barbie' would be better served watching 'Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy' (Simpsons s.5, ep.14), which is much more clever, funnier, and a lot shorter. Evidence that 'Barbie' has not shamed me out of my gynophilic mindset: I rated the movie an extra star simply because Margot Robbie is soooo pretty.",lot plastic fantast,plagu strang unbarbielik thought barbi margot robbi leav barbielend realworld along tagalong ken ryan gosl doll reject child discov maledomin realworld tast the film fun moment especi first third fabul imageri socialmessag bit heavyhand i quickli lost interest stori especi intermin unmemor songand danc number anyon interest parodi mattel barbi would better serv watch lisa v malibu staci simpson ep much clever funnier lot shorter evid barbi shame gynophil mindset i rate movi extra star simpli margot robbi soooo pretti
Didn't meet my expectations,"I wanted to love this movie but it just wasn't it :(It was nothing that hasn't been done before. It didn't really say anything. I hate using the word woke, but hearing the same talking points is tiring. We understand, the patriarchy is bad. But I didn't go to this movie to be preached to.I was hoping it would be a bit more camp. I was expecting it to be like the Barbie animated films you get, which ngl, are usually good. This was far from that.The ending was also a bit dragged out. It was trying very hard to be profound and it wasn't working.I didn't care for any of the characters much either and was a little sad to not see Raquelle or any of Barbie's sisters apart from Skipper.Apart from the criticism, I thought the costume design was really well executed.

Barbie is a totally meta movie,"It is a wonder that a live action ""Barbie"" movie came to be, and it's a wonder how Mattel has let it happen. This is a totally meta movie, so self-conscious. It knows what it stands for, what it wants to say and what it represents. It's a work done by a woman, it's obvious in every dialogue and every frame. Mattel is very supportive of what it says, it's actually really forward of them that they enabled this to happen. Greta took a chance and rather than making just another studio movie, she crafted a masterpiece. ""Barbie"" is all about self-identity and discovery and it's a journey to accepting once self and loving it. ""Barbie"" is the Barbie doll we know and still this movie showcases the effect of her on our lives now. It examines all the good and the bad ""Barbie"" has given to the world. It's a movie by a female director with a clear vision and a clear goal, it's made with absolute love and respect for the source material and with an eye for every minor detail. ""Barbie"" is a movie made by someone who knows the Barbie doll. ""Barbie"" is a funny movie, it really is very funny and so much fun. Margot Robbie is ""Barbie"", you simply believe it. She's given us her absolute best and it shows in every frame. Ryan Gosling must have had an absolute blast with Ken. He simply got the assignment.

A lot like The Lego Movie - except for the 2nd half,"As a guy who never played with Barbie dolls, I was surprised to be caught up in the enthusiasm to see this movie; I purchased tickets well in advance when they first went on sale.It's amazing to think that, a few years back, Amy Schumer was going to star in the title role. Though after seeing Margot Robbie, it's hard to imagine anyone else in that spot.Anyway ... like most moviegoers - I enjoyed this movie. It's a lot like The Lego Movie with its high energy, colorful world-building, meta jokes, self-aware characters and variety of insider (fan) humor. The ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" beginning, (clearly aimed at adult viewers) was priceless.However unlike The Lego Movie I can definitely say that the first half was enormously more entertaining compared to the second. The first half was energized by all the Barbie accessories, character introductions, high-energy music and a very cool plot reveal involving the ""real world"".But unlike The Lego Movie, the second half (while not bad) wasn't able to keep the momentum going. While there was a lot of action and drama ... it felt more hit-and-miss.The message was good: you don't have to be perfect to be happy ... just be true to yourself. However, its delivery felt a bit too complex for kids - and maybe even for some adults.The empowering commentary about womanhood was eloquent ... but it seemed like the writers had trouble getting from that point to a strong and uplifting ending. It almost felt a bit melancholy for whatever reason.But - don';t let that stop you from enjoying this movie! There's a lot to like and it's kind of a cultural moment and opportunity to connect with all the Barbie-love that spans generations.

A lot of fun and surprisingly funny,"The movie is surprisingly well written. Yes it is a fluff piece, it's called Barbie after all, but for what it was a lot of thought went into all the little details.Fun both in barbieland and the real world, the jokes were surprising as quite a few of them were at Mattel's expense.It tackles real world issues but in a fun and light hearted way. It is however 100% targeted at women, I'd say middle aged since that was the majority of the theater and the topics not really suitable for young girls.I do wonder if it was a bit harsh on men as it did lean way too much into He vs She debate in the second half.Margot Robbie was amazing as Barbie but Ryan Gosling very much stole the show.

Cute but shallow,"So I headed to the cinema to watch Barbie, the new live-action adaptation of the beloved doll franchise. I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it fell short. Barbie takes us on a journey, with Margot Robbie portraying ""Stereotypical"" Barbie as she leaves her world of Barbieland and enters the Real World. She encounters friends, overcomes challenges, and discovers important lessons about herself and others. Barbie doesn't always hit the mark while attempting to blend comedy, drama and fantasy elements. The plot feels predictable and filled with clichés, and the theme and tone are sometimes inconsistent and confusing. The acting and characters come across as stereotypes (something expected in Barbieland but not in the Real World).Nevertheless, Greta Gerwig's direction is skilful and imaginative; Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt's music is catchy and uplifting; Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is vibrant with a burst of colours. The movie also incorporates intriguing symbolism and production design by contrasting Barbie's sparkly world with the realism of the Real World. The animation breathes life into Barbie's world on screen. Amidst it all are some moments accompanied by clever dialogue-particularly from Ken (played by Ryan Gosling), who, as you would expect, serves as Barbie's trusty sidekick, desperately wanting to be noticed and appreciated by Barbie.I had some issues with the movie because it only scratched the surface when exploring its themes. Throughout the story, Barbie touched on topics like death, unattainable perfection, gender roles, body image and self-esteem. However, it merely skimmed over these issues superficially, like snacking on junk food instead of having a substantial meal.Barbie isn't a masterpiece. It's not a disaster, either. It's an entertaining film for kids and adults. The movie attempts to convey a message about embracing oneself and accepting others. It doesn't do so convincingly or in an original way. It left me feeling amused and bored.Cute but shallow.",cute shallow,so i head cinema watch barbi new liveact adapt belov doll franchis i high hope unfortun fell short barbi take u journey margot robbi portray stereotyp barbi leav world barbieland enter real world she encount friend overcom challeng discov import lesson other barbi doesnt alway hit mark attempt blend comedi drama fantasi element the plot feel predict fill clich theme tone sometim inconsist confus the act charact come across stereotyp someth expect barbieland real worldnevertheless greta gerwig direct skil imagin mark ronson andrew wyatt music catchi uplift rodrigo prieto cinematographi vibrant burst colour the movi also incorpor intrigu symbol product design contrast barbi sparkli world realism real world the anim breath life barbi world screen amidst moment accompani clever dialogueparticularli ken play ryan gosl would expect serv barbi trusti sidekick desper want notic appreci barbiei issu movi scratch surfac explor theme throughout stori barbi touch topic like death unattain perfect gender role bodi imag selfesteem howev mere skim issu superfici like snack junk food instead substanti mealbarbi isnt masterpiec it disast either it entertain film kid adult the movi attempt convey messag embrac oneself accept other it doesnt convincingli origin way it left feel amus boredcut shallow
I didn't think it would be good.,"But damnit, it was GREAT. The opening scene was good, then the first scene in Barbieland worried me. Not worried me like it would be bad, but that I would be right: that it would be good by virtue of being so over the top. And it was that too. But it's a surprisingly serious movie. In theme, not execution. But it says a lot of quiet parts out loud. What we did with our Barbies. To them. Who is Ken anyway? Why is Ken? What is death and why does it matter? What is motivation and what is success? What is feminism and what is dementia t progress? Honestly. I would have thought you were blowing my horn. And that sounds fun for a Friday night, but this is worth it. And a good movie to brave the theater for. The link was weird but vibrant and balanced in a way the big screen really lit up.Also, no spoilers, but the Ken bonfires scene made me actually laugh out loud.

"Barbie, Swing and a Miss","This film had the potential to become a cult classic with its strong cast, stunning costumes, and iconic character. However, it failed to live up to expectations, falling flat just like *spoiler Barbie's heels.The script initially captured the essence of little girls playing with their Barbie dolls, evoking a sense of nostalgia. Barbie dolls were once seen as limitless in their potential, inspiring young girls to explore various careers and fields, including STEM-based jobs. She helped promote young girls interest in science, engineering, math, and technology to hopefully bridge gender gaps in these fields. Barbie encouraged girls to dream big, fostered a love for learning and promoted self-confidence.Barbie symbolizes beauty and fashion-forwardness, allowing young girls to express themselves and embrace their individuality through styling their dolls. Playing with Barbies also promoted emotional intelligence, empathy, creativity, and problem-solving as girls created their own storylines and engaged in role-playing.Regrettably, this movie seemed to disregard the sentimental value associated with the traditional Barbie doll. Instead of embracing themes of friendship, teamwork, feminism, and self-discovery, the film failed to deliver. The friendships between the Barbie characters felt superficial, lacking depth. Rather than promoting equality and dismantling the patriarchy, the movie shifted to a full blown matriarchal focus, missing an opportunity to advocate for gender equality and alliances. There's a monologue by America Ferrera's character that just feels like a very negative view point on being a woman today. I thought it would start that way then maybe turn back toward how beautiful it is to be a woman... but it never did.In the spirit of equality, I also had high hopes this film would promote Barbie and not just a girls toy, but a great toy for any kid (girl or boy). It didn't go there at all.One aspect that felt problematic was the portrayal of Barbie and Ken's relationship, which verged on being toxic. It was evident that Barbie did not reciprocate Ken's feelings, creating an uncomfortable dynamic. The movie missed an opportunity to address this issue and explore the importance of open communication and respecting others' feelings. Ken, was extremely co-dependent and Barbie just saw him as an accessory. Yet when the tables were turned she didn't really learn anything from that.In terms of humor, the movie fell short of expectations. Most of the funny lines that appeared in the trailer seemed to be the highlights, leaving the rest of the film lacking in comedic impact. Additionally, the Ken dolls singing and fighting montage felt out of place, adding nothing substantial to the plotline. It came across as awkward and disconnected, failing to contribute meaningfully to the story.Overall, the film missed opportunities to address important relationship dynamics and deliver consistent humor, leaving these aspects underdeveloped and unsatisfying for the viewers.Additionally, Barbie's journey of self-discovery felt underwhelming, culminating in an anticlimactic ending at the gynecologist's office. It would have been more impactful if her desire to become human stemmed from her longing to share the qualities that Barbie stands for with the real world: friendship, kindness, perseverance, self-expression, and imagination. Sure she's 'ordinary real-world' Barbie but that doesn't mean she can't have extraordinarily character. The story just seemed to glaze over the opportunity to drive home a real lesson for the audience.Overall, I had really high expectations and this movie fell short in my book.",barbi swing miss,thi film potenti becom cult classic strong cast stun costum icon charact howev fail live expect fall flat like spoiler barbi heelsth script initi captur essenc littl girl play barbi doll evok sen nostalgia barbi doll seen limitless potenti inspir young girl explor variou career field includ stembas job she help promot young girl interest scienc engin math technolog hope bridg gender gap field barbi encourag girl dream big foster love learn promot selfconfidencebarbi symbol beauti fashionforward allow young girl express embrac individu style doll play barbi also promot emot intellig empathi creativ problemsolv girl creat storylin engag roleplayingregrett movi seem disregard sentiment valu associ tradit barbi doll instead embrac theme friendship teamwork femin selfdiscoveri film fail deliv the friendship barbi charact felt superfici lack depth rather promot equal dismantl patriarchi movi shift full blown matriarch focu miss opportun advoc gender equal allianc there monologu america ferrera charact feel like neg view point woman today i thought would start way mayb turn back toward beauti woman never didin spirit equal i also high hope film would promot barbi girl toy great toy kid girl boy it didnt go allon aspect felt problemat portray barbi ken relationship verg toxic it evid barbi reciproc ken feel creat uncomfort dynam the movi miss opportun address issu explor import open commun respect other feel ken extrem codepend barbi saw accessori yet tabl turn didnt realli learn anyth thatin term humor movi fell short expect most funni line appear trailer seem highlight leav rest film lack comed impact addit ken doll sing fight montag felt place ad noth substanti plotlin it came across awkward disconnect fail contribut meaning storyoveral film miss opportun address import relationship dynam deliv consist humor leav aspect underdevelop unsatisfi viewersaddit barbi journey selfdiscoveri felt underwhelm culmin anticlimact end gynecologist offic it would impact desir becom human stem long share qualiti barbi stand real world friendship kind persever selfexpress imagin sure she ordinari realworld barbi doesnt mean cant extraordinarili charact the stori seem glaze opportun drive home real lesson audienceoveral i realli high expect movi fell short book

"I get what you're saying, but..","As a woman, I could relate to every message and every line said in the movie. That may be the problem: verbally explaining through Baribe and Gloria's line most of the time rather than portraying what the problem is. It's like my mom giving me a lot of wonderful advice, but what changes me the most is what I see with my own eyes. To get the message crossed, 'Barbie' loses the tension of the story as time passes.'Barbie' is upbeat, bright, and cheerful; the comedy aspect really works for adults as well. The first half is really great and engrossing, but from the part where Barbie & Gloria and Mattel people go back to Barbieland, it loses power and attractions. 'I'm Just Ken' sequence is boring, and how Barbies solve the problem is super easy and simple because it's in Barbieland. I feel even defeated how gender inequality is treated this lightly and carefreelySoundtrack is the best quality. Billie Eilish's song at the end almost saves the film. Four-minute song captures more essence and core of 'Barbie' than the film itself.",i get your say,a woman i could relat everi messag everi line said movi that may problem verbal explain barib gloria line time rather portray problem it like mom give lot wonder advic chang i see eye to get messag cross barbi lose tension stori time passesbarbi upbeat bright cheer comedi aspect realli work adult well the first half realli great engross part barbi gloria mattel peopl go back barbieland lose power attract im just ken sequenc bore barbi solv problem super easi simpl barbieland i feel even defeat gender inequ treat lightli carefreelysoundtrack best qualiti billi eilish song end almost save film fourminut song captur essenc core barbi film
Gave up halfway through,"I didn't expect a lot, but got even less. I just found it irritating from start to finish - well, start to halfway, because I just couldn't take any more. I had thought that maybe it would be clever like Enchanted (the original, not the appalling sequel) with a short sequence in Barbie World (like Enchanted's cartoon cliche intro) and then quickly turn into a humorous and entertaining fish out of water story of Barbie adapting to the real world. Instead the opening Barbie World sequence goes way too long, and then the 'real' world she goes to isn't just short, it's more plastic and silly than Barbie World. When she returned to Barbie World, I couldn't take anymore and switched off. My advice? If you're not hooked by the first 15 minutes, do the same. It only gets worse.",gave halfway,i didnt expect lot got even le i found irrit start finish well start halfway i couldnt take i thought mayb would clever like enchant origin appal sequel short sequenc barbi world like enchant cartoon clich intro quickli turn humor entertain fish water stori barbi adapt real world instead open barbi world sequenc goe way long real world goe isnt short plastic silli barbi world when return barbi world i couldnt take anymor switch my advic if your hook first minut it get wors
A triumph,"I appreciated it but wasn't a huge fan of Greta Gerwig's first two films. I knew absolutely nothing about Barbie except that it was a doll. The trailers didn't impress me. I slept less than an hour last night. I watched the movie alone surrounded by teenagers who cheered when the WB logo appeared in pink.The conditions were set for this to go wrong, but Gerwig's vision for Barbie won me over. The film starts in the perfect, goofy, and funny Barbie Land, but it doesn't take long to move to the real world. Curiously, while most of the action in the real world works well, it's also where I felt some issues, mainly with the Mattel executives' characters. Let's say it was the only time I felt that the silliness of the film (and it's indeed very silly) went too far. The third act wraps everything up perfectly, with some fantastic speeches and a strong conclusion. Margot Robbie is great in the role of Barbie, but there's a big surprise in America Ferrera, and Ryan Gosling steals all the attention whenever he's on screen. All the supporting cast is hilarious.Younger audiences will love the colours, the incredible production design, and the light tone. However, this is a very adult film in the themes it addresses, managing to be highly relevant without ever ceasing to entertain. The feminist traits are well-defined, and it's an homage to women, but not only that. It's primarily about self-discovery, finding our own path, and being true to ourselves.",a triumph,i appreci wasnt huge fan greta gerwig first two film i knew absolut noth barbi except doll the trailer didnt impress i slept le hour last night i watch movi alon surround teenag cheer wb logo appear pinkth condit set go wrong gerwig vision barbi the film start perfect goofi funni barbi land doesnt take long move real world curious action real world work well also i felt issu mainli mattel execut charact let say time i felt silli film inde silli went far the third act wrap everyth perfectli fantast speech strong conclus margot robbi great role barbi there big surpris america ferrera ryan gosl steal attent whenev he screen all support cast hilariousyoung audienc love colour incred product design light tone howev adult film theme address manag highli relev without ever ceas entertain the feminist trait welldefin homag woman it primarili selfdiscoveri find path true
Honestly - no idea why people are so hyped up with this,"Honestly I really have no idea why this movie seems to be so popular. Again honest - I went there just for Margot Robbie (I'm a married 34 year old male, and margot is one of my top 3 favorite actrices of all time, and arguably the most talented one from my list). And for that part it was totally ok. But the movie absolutely doesn't deserve an imdb rating above 5.6. The plot itself was very simple. Absolutely nothing particularly special in it. So if it is in fact getting rated so high just because of Margot alone, then why do her other movies don't get rated that well and get that much attention? Honestly I really don't understand and I think this movie is way too overhyped for no reason. And I have no idea why... For other movies that get hyped like that I do see the reasons why they're getting so hyped. So the movie is not awful, but it's rather average, if you're not going there specifically for Margot then I am pretty sure there will be multiple movies at your local cinema at the time you're reading this, which are way more worth watching than this one...",honestli idea peopl hype,honestli i realli idea movi seem popular again honest i went margot robbi im marri year old male margot one top favorit actric time arguabl talent one list and part total ok but movi absolut doesnt deserv imdb rate the plot simpl absolut noth particularli special so fact get rate high margot alon movi dont get rate well get much attent honestli i realli dont understand i think movi way overhyp reason and i idea for movi get hype like i see reason theyr get hype so movi aw rather averag your go specif margot i pretti sure multipl movi local cinema time your read way worth watch one

It gently pushed me into self reflection and introspection which I never realised I needed to do for the longest of time.The movie dealt with so many issues, such as societal expectancies, emotional depence, perfectionism, stress, anxiety.. It brought forward self awareness, emotional intelligence, and so many insights into ones self.This movie is a must see for all women and men who are open to growth and developing their mindsets.As a millenial this movie resonated on another level, it reminded me of the self I was at a younger age, before falling into societal norms.Will definitely watch it again and again.",take mom sister daughter aunt everyon see movi,thi movi unexpectedcomplet opposit i thought would beth best movi ive seen long timether moment laugh moment tear it gentli push self reflect introspect i never realis i need longest timeth movi dealt mani issu societ expect emot depenc perfection stress anxieti it brought forward self awar emot intellig mani insight one selfthi movi must see woman men open growth develop mindsetsa milleni movi reson anoth level remind self i younger age fall societ normswil definit watch
Not a film that will hold up (and not because of its politics),"This movie falls apart with any sort of critical evaluation. There are good and funny moments of the film, but I don't think the film is going to hold up in the coming years. It claims to be an examination of feminism through the eyes of this doll. The dolls think that they have solved the problems of the real world by their existence, a trip to the real world makes it clear that this is not the case. The Kens, who are an underclass in the fantasy world, stage a rebellion and take it over. The rebellion is put down and everything returns to the status quo. And the status quo is not gender equality, it's a ruling class and a subservient class. Stripping the ideology away from the film, the story of how this universe works doesn't make any sense. The dolls are the way they are because of the way that children are playing with them. So if there is sort of a matriarchal Utopia, it's because little girls and little boys who are playing with the dolls have created it. So the ending of the film doesn't make any sense because the Barbies say that they don't want to return to the status quo and the Kens are learning about the real me. But they're not real. They're dolls, and their realities are determined for them. That's not the only weird part about the movie, there's the scene where the creator of the Barbie holds hands with Barbie and shows her all the feelings of a woman so that she can decide if she wants to be real or not. But in that montage, are no scenes of pain and suffering. So this Barbie becomes a real person and is set up for a life of horrible suffering because she does not understand the reality of pain. She hasn't even had a stomach ache before, or even digested food before, and now she's going to be a real woman? I don't mind films having ideologies, but I think the way filmmaking is going is not a direction in which I can follow. Apart from superhero movies, which people finally seem to be tired of, modern movie making is more about the feeling of a story, than the story. And I think there are a lot of problems with traditional storytelling and films, like the fact there are never unhappy endings in Hollywood blockbusters. But the structure of storytelling is one which gives satisfaction to the viewer because they can feel the process of the story coming together, and if there's no actual story where is the satisfaction for the viewer?",not film hold polit,thi movi fall apart sort critic evalu there good funni moment film i dont think film go hold come year it claim examin femin eye doll the doll think solv problem real world exist trip real world make clear case the ken underclass fantasi world stage rebellion take the rebellion put everyth return statu quo and statu quo gender equal rule class subservi class strip ideolog away film stori univers work doesnt make sen the doll way way child play so sort matriarch utopia littl girl littl boy play doll creat so end film doesnt make sen barbi say dont want return statu quo ken learn real but theyr real theyr doll realiti determin that weird part movi there scene creator barbi hold hand barbi show feel woman decid want real but montag scene pain suffer so barbi becom real person set life horribl suffer understand realiti pain she hasnt even stomach ach even digest food she go real woman i dont mind film ideolog i think way filmmak go direct i follow apart superhero movi peopl final seem tire modern movi make feel stori stori and i think lot problem tradit storytel film like fact never unhappi end hollywood blockbust but structur storytel one give satisfact viewer feel process stori come togeth there actual stori satisfact viewer
We're All Dolls,"Without consumerism, without belief, without plastic accessory and hope for a perfect day, where would Barbie find herself?And more importantly where would we find ourselves?In a plot that seems stitched together like an old pair of vintage jeans (that you just can't let go of), Greta Gerwig serves us a platter of modern satire and deep analysis of the condition that we find ourselves in today.Barbie is perfect. Until she's not. And she's becomes accustomed to our culture. The perspective of an otherwise perfect doll born from a matriarchy is wholly interesting and captivating as we laugh, hate and cry throughout the movie. Barbie must find out what is wrong with her owner but in doing so she discovers imperfect humanity and falls in love with it. This is the story and it is told brilliantly.There is no need to mention the phenomenal performances by each and every actor in this film. The set design, the costumes, the cinematography are all a testament to Greta Gerwigs skill as a director.To view this film as merely a feminist blockbuster is to ignore the fact that feminism is not just woman's problem but a humanity's problem. This is what the movie displays. Go into it with an open mind and you will see that it does not preach for women to rule men but for men and women to discover themselves without being pressured by the culture around them. A message which needs to be broadcast across the world in a time of such needless division.We are all forced to live like dolls in this world and we must escape from this and discover ourselves. It is amazing to see Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach tackle such daring themes and pull it off. The comedy throughout provided by celebrity cameos and hilarious satire is spot on.The soundtrack is astounding and in particular Billie Eilish's song ""What was I made for?"" is a fantastic close to the journey of discovery that Barbie and Ken have been through.A brilliant achievement in modern film making that makes me hopeful for the future as we tackle more and more complex issues head on - rather than watch boring old men debate uselessness on YouTube.",were all doll,without consumer without belief without plastic accessori hope perfect day would barbi find herselfand importantli would find ourselvesin plot seem stitch togeth like old pair vintag jean cant let go greta gerwig serv u platter modern satir deep analysi condit find todaybarbi perfect until she and she becom accustom cultur the perspect otherwis perfect doll born matriarchi wholli interest captiv laugh hate cri throughout movi barbi must find wrong owner discov imperfect human fall love thi stori told brilliantlyther need mention phenomen perform everi actor film the set design costum cinematographi testament greta gerwig skill directorto view film mere feminist blockbust ignor fact femin woman problem human problem thi movi display go open mind see preach woman rule men men woman discov without pressur cultur around a messag need broadcast across world time needle divisionw forc live like doll world must escap discov it amaz see greta gerwig noah baumbach tackl dare theme pull the comedi throughout provid celebr cameo hilari satir spot onth soundtrack astound particular billi eilish song what i made fantast close journey discoveri barbi ken througha brilliant achiev modern film make make hope futur tackl complex issu head rather watch bore old men debat useless youtub
A Stellar First Two Acts Followed by a Relatively Disappointing Third,"Barbie is agonizingly close to being a masterpiece. Imagine your run of the mill 2020s high budget film. Now let's go through it with a fine comb and add a bunch of brilliant tiny details to the first two acts, but then let's have a third act that fits the modern trend of overstaying its welcome and failing to provide satisfactory answers to its own questions and lacks all those fun little bits that made you love the first two thirds of the movie.Without spoiling plot, Barbie much like Game of Thrones and Hunger Games hints at complex understanding of social and political issues but ultimately settles on the safest most vanilla possible answers to those problems. It also, in modern fashion, wastes time going off on tangents.I feel, much like Margot Robbie, pulled in two directions. A part of me wants to praise the film for shedding on light on feminist issues while another wishes to tear it to shreds for copping out in the end.The further one gets into Barbie, the less its complexities feel like they are there to make a point, and the more it feels they are there to fill time.If you're like me you'll leave in a disappointed but forgiving mood. Even if the ending fumbles what was set up, I can't forget my enjoyment of the setting up itself.",a stellar first two act follow rel disappoint third,barbi agonizingli close masterpiec imagin run mill high budget film now let go fine comb add bunch brilliant tini detail first two act let third act fit modern trend overstay welcom fail provid satisfactori answer question lack fun littl bit made love first two third moviewithout spoil plot barbi much like game throne hunger game hint complex understand social polit issu ultim settl safest vanilla possibl answer problem it also modern fashion wast time go tangentsi feel much like margot robbi pull two direct a part want prais film shed light feminist issu anoth wish tear shred cop endth one get barbi le complex feel like make point feel fill timeif your like youll leav disappoint forgiv mood even end fumbl set i cant forget enjoy set
Why Didn't I Love This Movie?,"Why didn't I love 'Barbie'? I mean it's a brilliantly shot film. It's got a great Ryan Gosling, a very good Margot Robbie. Its heart is in the right place; its message is a good, politically correct, one. Its pacing is fine. Its not too long. So then, what was wrong?And the answer is (I guess) ... the story. The plot. While it's far from terrible it was also far from great. And - dare I say this? - it was at times confusing. Confusing in that I did not always understand the characters' motives. Why were these dolls thinking what they were thinking, or doing what they were doing? And yes I know we're talking about fantasy here, so we can't be, or shouldn't be, ascribing real human wants and desirers to these ... dolls. But the film's message is directed to humans, as played out through dolls, and so knowing the dolls wants and desires is not completely out of place.Because 'Barbie Dolls' are manufactured in different kinds of outfits (nurse, pilot, soldier) the film's Barbie-Land heroine, the 'Stereotypical Barbie' (Robbie), believes that real women are equally represented in / by human society. When she learns that is not the case, she travels to the 'real-world' to (a) learn more and (b) help out. What follows is a mish-mash of Barbie-Land male dolls (Gosling) awakening to the benefits of the macho life while its female dolls acquiesce to male demands. That is, until they are awakened by the return of Barbie and some real-world friends. And real-world women's-rights lecturing.At least I think that was what was going on. I say that because while watching the film it had nothing resembling this clarity. So I guess, consciously or otherwise, I thought about it afterward and came up with that theory.My way of saying (a) I could very well be wrong and (b) You might come up with an altogether different interpretation.And I guess that's the answer. Clarity or lack of. That's why I didn't love it.",whi didnt i love thi movi,whi didnt i love barbi i mean brilliantli shot film it got great ryan gosl good margot robbi it heart right place messag good polit correct one it pace fine it long so wrongand answer i guess stori the plot while far terribl also far great and dare i say time confus confus i alway understand charact motiv whi doll think think and ye i know talk fantasi cant shouldnt ascrib real human want desir doll but film messag direct human play doll know doll want desir complet placebecaus barbi doll manufactur differ kind outfit nurs pilot soldier film barbieland heroin stereotyp barbi robbi believ real woman equal repres human societi when learn case travel realworld learn b help what follow mishmash barbieland male doll gosl awaken benefit macho life femal doll acquiesc male demand that awaken return barbi realworld friend and realworld womensright lecturingat least i think go i say watch film noth resembl clariti so i guess conscious otherwis i thought afterward came theorymi way say i could well wrong b you might come altogeth differ interpretationand i guess that answer clariti lack that i didnt love
Barbie is the film we need right now,"I say this without a shred of irony; Greta Gerwig's Barbie is undoubtedly the film we so desperately need right now. This is the movie of our time - a film that shows us what life and society are like now, as well as shows us how we can do better. Plus, the movie is pure joy! It's a perfect mix of existentialism, heartfelt and important social-commentary and unapologetic silliness. This is the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time - and yet thanks to Gerwig's incredible script it also manages to be very a profound exploration of feminism, existentialism, the patriarchy, and masculinity all packaged in a satirical musical comedy homage to the fabric of cinema.This movie is so hard for me to review... because it's just SO GOOD! Like oh my god go see it right now, it's incredible, important, and so much fun! Genuinely, it's the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time - it's filled with pure joy and hope! Barbie exceeded all my expectations and completely lives up to the hype surrounding it! Honestly, it's pretty much a perfect film! I had a freaking blast with the movie - I loved everything it did! It's pretty much the funnest movie ever!As I write this review and reflect on the film, I had the sudden urge to revisit Greta Gerwig's breakout directorial effort; Lady Bird, and was struck by how strong and unique a voice Gerwig has as a filmmaker. Having seen her take on Little Women and now Barbie, I can easily say she is one of the most interesting and talented filmmakers working today! I'm super impressed with Gerwig as a filmmaker - all her movies are completely different and she has avoided being placed in a box. The film industry wants you to do what they know you can do very well - it wants to place filmmakers in a box, labeling someone as only a horror filmmaker, another who only does comedies, etc. Because of her ability to do LOTS of different things very well, she has been able to avoid being labeled as only one thing, making her one of the most interesting filmmakers working today. She has shown herself to be very versatile - truly on the level of Spielberg. She's easily one of the greatest of her generation. I also really love how she isn't afraid to tackle complex social issues in her films, and she somehow always manages to find really profound and interesting ways to communicate her messages. She blends social commentary with story to the point that a scene can be both emotional and profound while also hilarious and entertaining at the same time! Gerwig is also a very economical, smart storyteller - every shot, action, and line of dialogue tells us something about character or story, nothing is wasted! Plus, Gerwig seems to be endlessly creative and really commits to her visions. I've become a huge fan of Gerwig's work and Barbie has just solidified my love for her as a filmmaker!Greta Gerwig's work in Barbie is the literal definition of innovative and insightful direction with an actual authentic voice and vision to back it up. If the movie is honoured, she better come along with it. It all starts with her, and in anyone else's hands, it all falls flat. What could've been a soulless, superficial cash grab becomes something so singular, subversive, and stirring. No one could make this movie like her. She IS the movie.The secret weapon of Barbie is that magic ability Gerwig has as a writer and director to strike such a perfect balance between message and entertainment, which is something that is incredibly hard to do! Don't expect this film to be just another toy brand adaptation like the Transformers films, this is not forgettable, mindless entertainment. Barbie is trying to teach us something and has lessons that people need to hear. The commentary isn't heavy-handed or forced at all, it feels natural and, in fact, the way they comment on gender roles, masculinity and femininity, and the stereotypes of those is a lot of fun while also making you think! Like the best comedies, it is able to layer in commentary to all of the humour - the film has a really healthy sense of humour for all the themes it is exploring! I just absolutely love that in a given scene I could be laughing so hard, and yet also really engaging with the thematic and emotional material in that same scene to the extent that I did. Scenes would be both really funny and yet deep and insightful at the same time; it's very rare a film with this strong a message is this entertaining! My god Greta Gerwig is a master! Even the humour was so well done - it was so unexpected and willing to do anything! I loved it! It was a combination of both high and low-brow humour; I loved the goofiness and the slapstick elements to it, but also really loved that it managed to balance this over-the-top humour with really clever wordplay and more subtle, dryly delivered dialogue! And the fact it never took away from the seriousness or importance of a scene was just stunning to me! You can really tell Gerwig and Noah Baumbach had a lot of fun writing this one - and I'm amazed Mattel and Warner Bros allowed them to get away with some of the things they did!Though Barbie is largely silly and satirical (and yes, a ""studio movie""), there are so many moments where Greta Gerwig's singular style shines and it takes your breath away - one of the most unforgettable moments in the film is Barbie on the bench, experiencing every human emotion for the first time. (You'll know it when you see it.) I think scenes like this show that, while Barbie does have a lot to say about womanhood and coming-of-age as a woman in a complicated and contradictory world, it's ultimately just as much about what it means to be alive and be a human in general. And no one is excluded from that. (Men, I'm looking at you.)I know a lot of guys might not think they are part of the target audience for the film. But trust me, I'm a guy, and I LOVED it. I connected with so many of the themes and loved getting to see my girlfriend connect with even more of them. This movie is for everyone. Sure, women will identify with it in some areas a lot more than others will, but there is much to offer for everyone else. This movie is a film everyone needs to see, and everyone would enjoy it if they gave it a chance! Trust me, go in with an open mind and I promise you won't be disappointed.The film tells a really moving story about what it means to be a woman in today's world, and you really don't have to be a woman to be moved by it! The screenplay and themes are so well done and get better and better as the film goes on as the deeper layers begin to reveal themselves. It's truly beautiful and so heartfelt - there is so much love in this movie for women and mothers! And really when it comes down to it, this is pretty much a story about finding yourself. It's about gender roles in society and the societal construct and expression of those roles. It's about how we cope and exist with models, role models, and other influences in society. It's a breakdown of Barbie (the doll) - what she did for the world that was both good and bad, and how she could possibly help it moving forward. Gerwig wasn't afraid to rip apart the way in which Barbie is an outdated concept and represents the worst of what we think gender means, such as how it has negatively influenced body image standards for women. Gerwig also ponders the extent that the legacy of Barbie has contributed to or detracted from feminist movements - has Barbie empowered women or instead created outdated stereotypes? Greta Gerwig almost did too good of a job for Mattel! I can't believe Mattel agreed to this, it very much critiques them and Barbie at times. It's just such a smart movie and manages to cover all these topics and themes in such a natural and entertaining way without ever feeling forced!And oh my god! America Ferrera has such a powerful monologue in the film about how women have to try to navigate society and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I saw the film. It's one of the most profound pieces of writing I've seen in quite a while and it's delivered beautifully. Probably the part of the movie that's stuck with me the most since watching it. It's sending an important message to the audience while also allowing the film's narrative to move forward smoothly and efficiently. And I can't even imagine how much it will mean to all the women and girls who see the film - I know it really meant a lot to my girlfriend and has allowed many women to feel seen! America Ferrera is the film's beating heart and luminous soul, she gives such a genuinely moving performance and a show-stopping monologue that had the audience applauding. No one can write a monologue like Greta Gerwig!As I said, the film meant a lot to my girlfriend, and I wanted to include these thoughts she had after we saw it, as I think it really shows how truly important the message of this film is:""Barbie is a movie about growing up and realizing womanhood isn't all pink, pleasure, and possibility. Realizing that much of the world will hate you - always - no matter what you do, simply because of who you are. Realizing that there comes a point when you either have to accept complacency within the patriarchy, or ostracization and vilification outside of it.Or, maybe there's another way. Maybe womanhood isn't all the fun and freedom dreamed up in youth, but maybe we don't have to abandon it entirely either. Maybe, just maybe, once we accept and begrudgingly embrace the often brutal reality of our everyday existence - while still retaining our inner strength at the same time - we can better reconcile all these cultural complications and contradictions and find a way to move through the world cautiously, but authentically. Revelling in our - and the world's - flaws instead of willfully overlooking them in favour of the fantasy.",barbi film need right,i say without shred ironi greta gerwig barbi undoubtedli film desper

What did I just watch?,"I feel... Confused? I guess?The old Barbies were part of my generation. I was skeptical but curious about the hype around that movie. Sooooo much advertisement everywhere that it made me nauseous.The movie starts and I'm like... This is gonna be long... And then it gets even longer and more and more political!I get it... They wanted to make a political movie about what women could be if we took down the patriarchy and the men can just be who they want to be with feelings and all.The execution is colorful and you feel the sarcasm in every choice the movie maker made.I would have given it a lower score but I gotta admire the research and execution.It seems I must have missed a lot of jokes because some people were laughing when I was not.What's up with having so many cast members of Sex Education?Also?!

This film isn't saying what it thinks it is,"Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, l'm in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.",thi film isnt say think,margot best she given film disappoint it market fun quirki satir homag movi it start way end overdramat speech end clearli tri make audienc feel someth left everyon feel confus and say im crotcheti old man lm im pretti sure im movi target audienc the saddest part parent kid theater victim poor market kid movi overal humor fun occas film beauti look whole concept fall apart second half film becom piti parti strong woman

I love it; almost all the song are catchy and complements the movie (like this song, by the way (Im just Ken)); the production set for this film is majestic, and parts of the movie are touching and somewhat relatable to our everyday life, and there can be something to learn from, very recommended to watch this with your whole family and friends.",barbi life lesson,i expect movi great im kind stuff still i watch man great scene relat peopl react someth nowaday like come everyth everyon cancel overal act cast super great i love almost song catchi complement movi like song way im ken product set film majest part movi touch somewhat relat everyday life someth learn recommend watch whole famili friend
"Great for the first 30 minutes, then not","The trailers and marketing for the movie were so good that I was really disappointed when the movie took an odd turn after 20-30 minutes into it.There could have been so many better turns than the one they took:
Barbie could have inspired the real world to be more Barbie-like (example: the movie Enchanted)Barbie could have spent her time in the real world helping the sad girlBarbie could have spent the whole rest of the movie in the real world figuring out who she wanted to beInstead it became an odd war between men and women, which in the end, ended with just as much inequality as there is in the real world but with women in power and men not even having any homes. I don't get why they went with that. The Barbie movie could have ended with equality.",great first minut,the trailer market movi good i realli disappoint movi took odd turn minut itther could mani better turn one took barbi could inspir real world barbielik exampl movi enchantedbarbi could spent time real world help sad girlbarbi could spent whole rest movi real world figur want beinstead becam odd war men woman end end much inequ real world woman power men even home i dont get went the barbi movi could end equal
Wonderful,"I went into the theater with no expectations, somebody had told me the movie was good and I was curious, but I didn't really know what I was getting into.This is an uncommon movie. The idea being ""we have been fooled. We were told feminism had succeeded and now we find out they had been playing with us"". To me, the use of the Barbie world and the Barbie concept is fantastic, as she's supposedly been for generations of girls, the icon, the perfect woman with the perfect life achieving all she wanted. But at the same time she has been accused of embodying all that is wrong: unrealistic expectations regarding body image etc etc. Steteotypical Barbie realizing that she's been living in a bubble and the real world is not what she has been told is simply a flawless way of transmitting the message. We are all Barbie at some point.The actors performances are simply perfect. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling could not have done a better job. The stenography, the colors, the clothes, everything is just a delight.This is by far the best movie I've seen this year. I know some people find it shallow, not for children, unfunny. To them I'd say perhaps they are not evaluating the movie from the correct perspective.Intelligent, deep and aesthetically wonderful. 10/10 from me.",wonder,i went theater expect somebodi told movi good i curiou i didnt realli know i get intothi uncommon movi the idea fool we told femin succeed find play u to use barbi world barbi concept fantast she supposedli gener girl icon perfect woman perfect life achiev want but time accus embodi wrong unrealist expect regard bodi imag etc etc steteotyp barbi realiz she live bubbl real world told simpli flawless way transmit messag we barbi pointth actor perform simpli perfect margot robbi ryan gosl could done better job the stenographi color cloth everyth delightthi far best movi ive seen year i know peopl find shallow child unfunni to id say perhap evalu movi correct perspectiveintellig deep aesthet wonder
Better and deeper than I expected and was definitely worth a watch,"Barbie (2023) is a movie that my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Barbie in a perfect world who believes she is the perfect role model for little girls in the real world. When things start feeling off for her in her world, she discovers she may need to go to the real world to set things right. When she gets to the real world, she discovers how wrong she was about being the perfect role model.This movie is directed by Greta Gerwig (Little Women) and stars Margot Robbie (Suicide Squad), Issa Rae (Insecure), Kathryn McKinnon (Bombshell), Ryan Gosling (The Notebook), Alexandra Shipp (X-Men: Apocalypse) and Will Ferrell (Elf).This movie had a lot more going for it than I anticipated. The universe and characters are very well developed, thoroughly put together with the history of the Barbie universe incorporated and a smart scripts. The dialogue and interactions were much deeper than I anticipated. There were a lot of good messages and lessons baked into the storyline. My only complaint was how much focus there was on the ""Ken's."" He was a worthwhile villain, but the ending dance scene and finding self moment was overdone; however, everything about the Barbie plot hit the nail on the head.Overall, this is better and deeper than I expected and was definitely worth a watch. I would score this a 7/10 and strongly recommend it.",better deeper i expect definit worth watch,barbi movi wife i saw theater last night the storylin follow barbi perfect world believ perfect role model littl girl real world when thing start feel world discov may need go real world set thing right when get real world discov wrong perfect role modelthi movi direct greta gerwig littl woman star margot robbi suicid squad issa rae insecur kathryn mckinnon bombshel ryan gosl the notebook alexandra shipp xmen apocalyps will ferrel elfthi movi lot go i anticip the univers charact well develop thoroughli put togeth histori barbi univers incorpor smart script the dialogu interact much deeper i anticip there lot good messag lesson bake storylin my complaint much focu ken he worthwhil villain end danc scene find self moment overdon howev everyth barbi plot hit nail headoveral better deeper i expect definit worth watch i would score strongli recommend
"Goofy, girly, and gorgeous","I knew going into Barbie that I was in for a visual feast. The trailers showcased the wonderful set design, costumes, and performances already. But I was not expecting how affecting this movie would be.Greta Gerwig proves for yet a third time that women's stories are worth telling with Barbie. Only she could look at the plastic empire and find a story about what it means to be a woman in a society that hates them. What's miraculous is she does this all while also proving that men still suffer in an unequal society as well. It's such a careful examination of the culture we live in, but it's also absolutely hysterical and includes some of the hardest laughs I've had at the movies all year.I know Greta's next project is a massive IP blockbuster, and while some might be worried that she's selling out, I'm not. She'll find new meaning to add in whatever she does.",goofi girli gorgeou,i knew go barbi i visual feast the trailer showcas wonder set design costum perform alreadi but i expect affect movi would begreta gerwig prove yet third time woman stori worth tell barbi onli could look plastic empir find stori mean woman societi hate what miracul also prove men still suffer unequ societi well it care examin cultur live also absolut hyster includ hardest laugh ive movi yeari know greta next project massiv ip blockbust might worri she sell im shell find new mean add whatev
"Many Will Go, Most Will Enjoy","Having just watched a woman drag her tween daughter out of the movie, trailed along a bit after by a couple of older sorts, I can tell you this movie is not what some people have envisioned.It is not a light-hearted children's film. It is PG-13 for a reason and also if you haven't taught your daughter the word ""patriarchy"" yet, that might be something to cover first.Second, it's not a paean to the Barbie doll, Barbie collectors, or Mattel as a corporation. Honestly, I'm not sure how they're signed on as producers except perhaps to prove the point that the corporation is all about a cash grab.(The execs come across as buffoons and their talking points about being there for little girls are definitely shredded in the early encounters. No room to come back.)So while many went into the theater this weekend expecting a fun movie, not everyone will enjoy the show.---I personally thought it was ok--not as grand as expected, but I got to the end well enough.The acting was the fun part, especially Ryan Gosling as the air headed and thwarted Ken--voice of male fragility.Songs are catchy ear worms. The sets are marvelous pop art pink and scaled to make things look doll-like.The plot is a weak point, I'll admit, being very simplistic.Honestly, however, I kind of expected that. (So unlike the women above neither stomped nor snuck out.)Mainly the message is to crush the patriarchy (ok--but where is Allan's role in this patriarchy and why is a pregnant Midge so looked down on, even now?And since the ending sees Mattel theoretically still ramping production, what did we actually learn from this messaging anyhow?)If the pitch was to be a pivot to a modernized Barbie, I'm not sure that marketing campaign did any favors. And if it was that humanism is more important than corporate greed, the associated marketing merch kind of undercut the message, too.At any rate, the directoral easter eggs kept me going through all of it (call back cinematic opening is just the start)
So there's good news and bad news, and maybe it's cost sunk fallacy making me give the film a seven. But I thought it was ""OK,"" so here we are.",mani will go most will enjoy,have watch woman drag tween daughter movi trail along bit coupl older sort i tell movi peopl envisionedit lightheart child film it pg reason also havent taught daughter word patriarchi yet might someth cover firstsecond paean barbi doll barbi collector mattel corpor honestli im sure theyr sign produc except perhap prove point corpor cash grabth exec come across buffoon talk point littl girl definit shred earli encount no room come backso mani went theater weekend expect fun movi everyon enjoy showi person thought oknot grand expect i got end well enoughth act fun part especi ryan gosl air head thwart kenvoic male fragilitysong catchi ear worm the set marvel pop art pink scale make thing look dollliketh plot weak point ill admit simplistichonestli howev i kind expect so unlik woman neither stomp snuck outmainli messag crush patriarchi okbut allan role patriarchi pregnant midg look even nowand sinc end see mattel theoret still ramp product actual learn messag anyhowif pitch pivot modern barbi im sure market campaign favor and human import corpor greed associ market merch kind undercut messag tooat rate director easter egg kept go call back cinemat open start so there good news bad news mayb cost sunk fallaci make give film seven but i thought ok
Dull and disappointing story,"First of all: Margot Robbie is great in the role of Barbie and I also loved the quirky colorful style of the movie from start to finish. Both the pink dominated Barbieland and also the transition over to the real world are well done in my opinion.Unfortunately there isn't much more to the movie than that. The story and its conclusion can be summarized in one sentence: Neither a male nor a female dominated world is good and we need to find a solution that works for both men and women. That's it, that's all.The story revolves around the word ""patriarchy"" with a few jokes sprinkled inbetween, none of which really worked for me. What's left is the empty feeling of lost potential.The main plot element of the first few minutes, the fact that Barbie suddenly isn't perfect anymore and has to deal with thoughts about death and anxiety while everyone around her keeps up the facade of perfection (that sounds interesting, right?), is almost completely ignored in favor of what I pointed out above; the same goes for the missed opportunity of seriously addressing the consumption culture that led to the creation of this ""perfect"" Barbieland in the first case. Yes, there's the running gag with Will Ferrell as a CEO and a bunch of other men in suits following him around but the few jokes that result out of this create nothing more than a cynical smile at best. It will not get you to actually think about or question anything in the real world which should be the goal of any good story. If you're lucky you might leave the theatre slightly amused but not with any new interesting thoughts or follow up questions on your mind.Then in its feminist territory where the movie does attempt to be critical, we mostly get these revelations about patriarchy and the oppression of women handed to us in embarrassing monologues. How can anyone enjoy this? 4/10 for the style and the acting.",dull disappoint stori,first margot robbi great role barbi i also love quirki color style movi start finish both pink domin barbieland also transit real world well done opinionunfortun isnt much movi the stori conclus summar one sentenc neither male femal domin world good need find solut work men woman that that allth stori revolv around word patriarchi joke sprinkl inbetween none realli work what left empti feel lost potentialth main plot element first minut fact barbi suddenli isnt perfect anymor deal thought death anxieti everyon around keep facad perfect sound interest right almost complet ignor favor i point goe miss opportun serious address consumpt cultur led creation perfect barbieland first case ye there run gag will ferrel ceo bunch men suit follow around joke result creat noth cynic smile best it get actual think question anyth real world goal good stori if your lucki might leav theatr slightli amus new interest thought follow question mindthen feminist territori movi attempt critic mostli get revel patriarchi oppress woman hand u embarrass monologu how anyon enjoy style act

I loved the costume and set design, it feels like everyone in this film really cared about the franchise of Barbie. I feel like all of imagination at play is gorgeous.

I went with my girlfriend and her two daughters and they enjoyed it.The sets were all very very well done. They put a lot of time into them. The acting was awful, but awful on purpose? I'm not sure. The plot was confusing at times. I wasn't sure what that big battle was for. Why were they fighting? No reason or lead up to it was there.I really enjoyed the scenes when they were in the real world. They did good with the 'fish out of water' thing. I laughed a couple times.The sexual innuendos were there and I thought they were funny but thankfully my girlfriends daughters did not understand them.I would say a 11-13 year old girl would enjoy this.",decent type,im man i know im clearli target demograph i went girlfriend two daughter enjoy itth set well done they put lot time the act aw aw purpos im sure the plot confus time i wasnt sure big battl whi fight no reason lead therei realli enjoy scene real world they good fish water thing i laugh coupl timesth sexual innuendo i thought funni thank girlfriend daughter understand themi would say year old girl would enjoy
Overrated,"This movie is a cinematic catastrophe that leaves viewers questioning the very fabric of reality. This film takes a seemingly interesting concept and turns it into an excruciatingly tiresome and overhyped ordeal that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.First and foremost, the titular character, barbie, is an annoying and grating presence from the moment she graces the screen. Her incessant whining, exaggerated emotions, and dramatic outbursts quickly wear out their welcome. It's like watching a never-ending loop of a soap opera with no redeeming qualities. Barbie's character is not only unrelatable but also unbearable, making it impossible to invest any emotional connection with her.The premise of a doll coming to life and entering the real world could have been intriguing, but it's executed with such carelessness and lack of creativity that it falls flat. Instead of exploring the endless possibilities of this concept, the movie opts for mind-numbing clichés and uninspired gags. It's as if the writers couldn't be bothered to put any effort into crafting a compelling narrative.The film's overhyped marketing and anticipation only serve to underscore its crushing disappointment. It's as if the marketing team desperately tried to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, and the result is a movie that leaves you wondering if you could have spent those precious hours doing something more worthwhile, this movie is a regrettable waste of time and money. Its annoying and one-dimensional protagonist, coupled with a lackluster plot and sluggish pacing, make it a forgettable cinematic experience. I strongly advise against watching this film and suggest looking elsewhere for more fulfilling and entertaining movie options.",overr,thi movi cinemat catastroph leav viewer question fabric realiti thi film take seemingli interest concept turn excruciatingli tiresom overhyp ordeal i wouldnt wish upon worst enemyfirst foremost titular charact barbi annoy grate presenc moment grace screen her incess whine exagger emot dramat outburst quickli wear welcom it like watch neverend loop soap opera redeem qualiti barbi charact unrelat also unbear make imposs invest emot connect herth premis doll come life enter real world could intrigu execut careless lack creativ fall flat instead explor endless possibl concept movi opt mindnumb clich uninspir gag it writer couldnt bother put effort craft compel narrativeth film overhyp market anticip serv underscor crush disappoint it market team desper tri make silk purs sow ear result movi leav wonder could spent preciou hour someth worthwhil movi regrett wast time money it annoy onedimension protagonist coupl lacklust plot sluggish pace make forgett cinemat experi i strongli advis watch film suggest look elsewher fulfil entertain movi option
It's not what you think.,"I am a MASSIVE and lifelong Barbie fanatic. I went in to this movie absolutely pumped. I came out of the movie blown away. Typical of Barbie, she blew me away with the absolute depth of her message. America Ferrera's monologue in Barbie Land had people clapping in the theatre. I appreciated it as a Mother, daughter, sister, wife and human being. The truth bombs she dropped got me right in the feels. I know. You are likely rolling your eyes and balking at the sheer IDEA that a BARBIE movie could be in any way profound. I say to you, you must not REALLY know Barbie then. This really was, if I think about it, in true Barbie fashion. Well done, my lady.

Well played.,"For me, Barbie came very, very close to an 8/10 rating. The only reason it didn't quite get there was that it contains a few scenes that are too long and a bit too weak.On the plus side, there are several more things to mention. First and foremost, Barbie has attracted a very strong cast, with well respected names also in several supporting roles, and they all perform well. Margot Robbie was almost an obvious casting choice. With her skills and her appearance, she really IS Barbie (with a brain) for almost two hours.Director Greta Gerwig and her crew created perfect Barbieland sets, which made me smile in spite of the fact that I never owned a Barbie doll myself.The film had me laughing many times, and it also brought me to tears a few times. Quite impressive for a movie about a doll, I thought.And, last but not least, the message of the movie. Already when I heard that Greta Gerwig was going to make a Barbie movie, I knew we were in for a culture clash. The fact that she went all-in was not surprising to me, but that she managed to convince Mattel to go along with her was. Kudos not only to Greta Gerwig for that, but also to Mattel. This may turn out to prove enormously profitable for them in the end, and they undoubtedly hope to make Barbie relevant for a few more generations. Nevertheless, this took guts on their part.

Intelligent and charming,"This movie is refreshingly intelligent and visually enchanting. The script is quite clever and fun, and get this: there is not one word of profanity. (This just goes to show that a blockbuster movie can be well-written and need not have dozens of f-bombs.) I give it even more bonus points for good actors who don't mumble. I was beginning to think that today's actors had forgotten that diction was a vital tool in their box. How refreshing to hear every word! Though it carries a powerful message about female empowerment, this is not a movie just for women. My husband enjoyed it very much. Young children won't get most of it, but they might enjoy the visuals. Highly recommended.",intellig charm,thi movi refreshingli intellig visual enchant the script quit clever fun get one word profan thi goe show blockbust movi wellwritten need dozen fbomb i give even bonu point good actor dont mumbl i begin think today actor forgotten diction vital tool box how refresh hear everi word though carri power messag femal empower movi woman my husband enjoy much young child wont get might enjoy visual highli recommend
Entertaining,"The Barbie movie brilliantly brings to life the magical universe of Mattel's iconic Barbie dolls, with Margot Robbie's exceptional portrayal of Barbie herself at the forefront. Robbie's performance is truly remarkable, capturing the essence of the beloved character with grace and charm. Her embodiment of Barbie's timeless appeal and elegance goes beyond mere physical resemblance.Robbie effortlessly transitions between the enchanting Barbieland and the real world, showcasing her versatility as an actress. As she navigates the fantastical landscapes of Barbieland or adjusts to the complexities of the real world, Robbie's portrayal remains captivating and genuine.Supported by Ryan Gosling's charismatic depiction of Ken, the film creates a delightful blend of humor, heart, and subtle social commentary. The visuals are a visual treat, capturing the vibrant beauty of Barbieland and the dynamic real-world settings.Furthermore, the movie subtly touches on various themes, adding depth to the narrative and making it not only entertaining but also thought-provoking.While some viewers might have hoped for a deeper exploration of the dynamics within the Mattel company, the overall experience remains highly enjoyable. The Barbie movie, led by Margot Robbie's outstanding performance, serves as a wonderful celebration of the iconic doll and the values she embodies. It's a must-watch that reignites our fascination with Barbie and leaves us inspired by the boundless possibilities she represents.",entertain,the barbi movi brilliantli bring life magic univers mattel icon barbi doll margot robbi except portray barbi forefront robbi perform truli remark captur essenc belov charact grace charm her embodi barbi timeless appeal eleg goe beyond mere physic resemblancerobbi effortlessli transit enchant barbieland real world showcas versatil actress a navig fantast landscap barbieland adjust complex real world robbi portray remain captiv genuinesupport ryan gosl charismat depict ken film creat delight blend humor heart subtl social commentari the visual visual treat captur vibrant beauti barbieland dynam realworld settingsfurthermor movi subtli touch variou theme ad depth narr make entertain also thoughtprovokingwhil viewer might hope deeper explor dynam within mattel compani overal experi remain highli enjoy the barbi movi led margot robbi outstand perform serv wonder celebr icon doll valu embodi it mustwatch reignit fascin barbi leav u inspir boundless possibl repres
A Surprisingly Entertaining and Funny Film,"Greta Gerwig's live-action Barbie is a surprisingly entertaining and funny film that will appeal to both kids and adults.The film is full of jokes and laugh-out-loud moments, and Ryan Gosling is a scene-stealer as Ken. He has eight abs, of course, but he also gives a surprisingly good performance. The film has a positive message about self-acceptance. Barbie learns that she doesn't have to be perfect to be loved and accepted.The film does have some flaws. The plot is a bit predictable, and the film could have been a bit shorter. However, the flaws are minor, and Barbie is ultimately a lot of fun. It's a great film for kids and adults alike, and it's sure to be a hit with fans of the iconic doll.",a surprisingli entertain funni film,greta gerwig liveact barbi surprisingli entertain funni film appeal kid adultsth film full joke laughoutloud moment ryan gosl scenesteal ken he eight ab cours also give surprisingli good perform the film posit messag selfaccept barbi learn doesnt perfect love acceptedth film flaw the plot bit predict film could bit shorter howev flaw minor barbi ultim lot fun it great film kid adult alik sure hit fan icon doll
Brilliant Filmmaking,"Finally went to see what this billion-dollar-grossing film was all about and...wow...what an awesome movie. I can see why misogynistic men have spoken very loudly against it.Was it cute? Yeah. Was it funny? Yeah. Was it full of pink and fun songs? Yeah. Was it full of a deep understanding of what women have gone through and...still go through as they try to deal with all of societies pressures...some by other women but most by the patriarchy that still want to see women living the lives they saw on TV growing up? Yeah.I knew the movie nailed it when Barbie and Ken first arrived in the Real World at the beach and he's thrilled to be there and doesn't see the underlying violence. But Barbie does...and she said she could see violence everywhere. Pretty much the same as in real life for women in bars, in dark parking lots, on the streets in broad day light.Lots of in jokes of the history of Barbie (I had a weird Barbie!), lots of adult themes that go over the heads of kids. (One day those little girls will grow up and understand the line ""you can't even beach yourself!"" And it will be funny.)

"Lots of people here say it's ""preachy."" And boy, is it ever!!","Making a light, entertaining comedy apparently wasn't enough for Gerwig and Baumbach. For some reason -- maybe to maintain their intellectual bona fides -- they couldn't resist weighing the movie down, after its light-hearted beginning, with increasingly serious Messages -- a whole heap of Messages, in fact, about Patriarchy and Feminine Self-Realization and What It Means to Be Human, blah blah blah, to the point where I tuned out all the sermonizing, all the earnest Life Lessons, and was simply grateful for the occasional chuckle.In support of one of its Messages, the filmmakers pretend that the toymaker's managing board is 100 percent male. (It's actually half female.)The high point of the movie comes in the opening minutes. I fell in love with that spot-on ""2001"" parody, even though it feels like an inspired afterthought. (So does Helen Mirren's brief narration.)The entire first third is amusing. After that, it's all downhill. ""Barbie"" becomes increasingly sour and eventually downright tedious. It's at least half an hour too long.I confess to being somewhat baffled by its success, both with critics and the public.",lot peopl say preachi and boy ever,make light entertain comedi appar wasnt enough gerwig baumbach for reason mayb maintain intellectu bona fide couldnt resist weigh movi lightheart begin increasingli seriou messag whole heap messag fact patriarchi feminin selfreal what it mean be human blah blah blah point i tune sermon earnest life lesson simpli grate occasion chucklein support one messag filmmak pretend toymak manag board percent male it actual half femaleth high point movi come open minut i fell love spoton parodi even though feel like inspir afterthought so helen mirren brief narrationth entir first third amus after downhil barbi becom increasingli sour eventu downright tediou it least half hour longi confess somewhat baffl success critic public
"Hardly any laughter in my theater, though perhaps the film wasn't meant to entertain","In one sense, this film was more inevitable than Thanos. What do you get when you're part of a society that fuels existential crises, by constantly eroding definitions and structures? Barbie and Ken aren't exactly human (they don't even have genitals); they're embodied ideas, and so they face this amorphous crisis of identity that pits their presuppositional views of a happy society against that of the ""real world."" But their perception of the real world is like seeing a plane for the first time and therefore thinking it's a dragon. So how much can an audience glean from the pontifications of characters who are essentially children? I would have greatly preferred scriptwriters more well-versed in sociology as well as comedy, writers who understand not only American ideals, and how those ideals have shifted, but the role that Barbie has played along the way. I get the sense that the writers here just KNOW Barbie had some impact, without really understanding much beyond that. There was so much to explore, and it could have been shown situationally, rather than through heavy-handed exposition.Off-screen, apparently Ken had some interesting realizations about his misunderstandings of patriarchy, and Barbie had some realizations about how she treated Ken, but we don't get to see any of this nuance actually played out. Hugely missed opportunities there.Bottom line: As fantastic as Robbie and Gosling were, I wish this movie just didn't exist. Keep the cast, but try again with a much better script and director.",hardli laughter theater though perhap film wasnt meant entertain,in one sen film inevit thano what get your part societi fuel existenti crise constantli erod definit structur barbi ken arent exactli human dont even genit theyr embodi idea face amorph crisi ident pit presupposit view happi societi real world but percept real world like see plane first time therefor think dragon so much audienc glean pontif charact essenti child i would greatli prefer scriptwrit wellvers sociolog well comedi writer understand american ideal ideal shift role barbi play along way i get sen writer know barbi impact without realli understand much beyond there much explor could shown situat rather heavyhand expositionoffscreen appar ken interest realiz misunderstand patriarchi barbi realiz treat ken dont get see nuanc actual play huge miss opportun therebottom line a fantast robbi gosl i wish movi didnt exist keep cast tri much better script director
Greta Gerwig has done it again,"In Greta's ""Barbie,"" the iconic doll takes on real-world problems in this comedy-meets-existential film, transforming from a seemingly superficial figure to a multi-dimensional character. Through physical and emotional challenges, Barbie discovers the true strength that comes from within, while the movie skillfully balances humor with deeper existential questions. As her journey unfolds, Barbie's exploration of empathy and self-discovery resonates profoundly with audiences, reminding them of the significance of creative freedom in cinema. The film's portrayal of Barbie's evolution from a controversial symbol to a beacon of empowerment becomes a captivating exploration of womanhood and the enduring spirit of femininity.",greta gerwig done,in greta barbi icon doll take realworld problem comedymeetsexistenti film transform seemingli superfici figur multidimension charact through physic emot challeng barbi discov true strength come within movi skill balanc humor deeper existenti question a journey unfold barbi explor empathi selfdiscoveri reson profoundli audienc remind signific creativ freedom cinema the film portray barbi evolut controversi symbol beacon empower becom captiv explor womanhood endur spirit feminin
"Brilliant first part, second part a bit confusing","I loved the first part of this movie. There is a a lot of excitement, wonder, meaning and humor. The main actors are very good and it all seems to be going so well. Barbie is looking for the girl who owned her in the real world. Ken hides in the back seat and comes along. At a certain point the movie becomes a story about the patriarchy suppressing women. There are some long speeches that really do not have a lot of emotional impact. At the start of the movie Ken is a puppet in Barbie world where Barbie controls everything, then it seems like they try to make the point that men and women don't need eachother and I don't think that is right. I think the movie should have been more fair to how men and women can be a great team in stead of being individuals and at odds. All in all I liked the movie, but it could have been better. If I'm saying that because I am a man and just don't get the plights of womanhood, then I'm sorry, but my experience in my own life is that it's not easy to be a man in this world of hours, I don't believe it's the case that men have all the advantages. Ken constantly confess his love to Barbie, but the movie says that his love is not real because he doesn't own Barbie. This to me does not represent men well. When I look around in the society I live in, I don't see men who own their women. I see men and women who love eachother and want to live together and I don't see what's wrong with that. I guess it would just be too traditional if that was the conclusion in this movie.",brilliant first part second part bit confus,i love first part movi there lot excit wonder mean humor the main actor good seem go well barbi look girl own real world ken hide back seat come along at certain point movi becom stori patriarchi suppress woman there long speech realli lot emot impact at start movi ken puppet barbi world barbi control everyth seem like tri make point men woman dont need eachoth i dont think right i think movi fair men woman great team stead individu odd all i like movi could better if im say i man dont get plight womanhood im sorri experi life easi man world hour i dont believ case men advantag ken constantli confess love barbi movi say love real doesnt barbi thi repres men well when i look around societi i live i dont see men woman i see men woman love eachoth want live togeth i dont see what wrong i guess would tradit conclus movi

A really fun time,"Weeks ago I heard that there was going to be a Barbie movie coming out and my immediate first thought was ""Oh, God."" I then forgot about it and then saw the trailer for it when we went to see the new Indiana Jones movie. I always enjoy seeing Margot Robbie when I can and Ryan Gosling looked like he was going to bring some humor to the movie, so when my wife asked if I wanted to see it, I said SURE! I'm glad I did.The movie was as amusing as I hoped, and it didn't overly rely on tired story lines to make it entertaining. What it also had was a lot of heart. Margot Robbie is an actress that has a ton of sex appeal, but she doesn't use it. She uses her great skill as an actress to convey the story and does it very well.What was really fun about this movie was listening to the kids in the theater responding to it and it was pretty hilarious. My daughter and I were laughing more at that than anything. It was actually a delightful surprise that added to the whole vibe of the movie.Ryan Gosling played a goofball Ken, but he does so in a very controlled and amusing way, and you actually feel for Ken bigtime as the story moves along. He did a great job as well as the rest of the cast that made up all the Barbies and Kens.The only thing I will say takes away from this movie is Will Ferrell. I normally find him amusing in most movies he is in, but in this one, he was completely superfluous. He added not a single laugh nor important aspect to the story line. He just was not needed in this movie.So, if you have a daughter of any age, go see it with her and laugh.

"Awkward, brilliant, anti-popcorn movie","The most surprising thing about Barbie is that the joke gets old so quickly. Then, after it stops beating the audience over the head with its obviousness, it settles into a self-assured groove. It's the rare case in which the third act is actually better than the first two. The jokes land harder once it sheds the need to be all things at once - a twist neatly mirroring the film's central crisis moment.As it plays out, the first half of Barbie is surprisingly drab. It's a feat of production and winking self reference that threatens to turn into a painful civics lesson and a generic every-genre-all-at-once lecture. It's not nearly as weird or jarring as it needs to be, and ultimately, the Barbie world is as lifeless as the titular character.But then, something interesting happens: Barbie actually starts landing some punches. It's no accident that a turn happens with the introduction of a fairly obvious twist - the introduction of a strange character played by Rhea Perlman. And Perlman is the perfect actress to fill such a role. She's small, unglamorous, and crone-ish, consistently cast as either a venomous tough or as a matronly sieve. In Barbie, she's a literal chorus, and her existence in the film suggests a knowing concession between the Corporate Barbie toy empire and the relationship that so many women have with her, and themselves.These are the topics that have long churned in Noah Baumbach's films combined with topics that have defined Gerwig's features, yet the movie doesn't work like anything the two have accomplished separately. Barbie feels like Ladybird by way of The Life Aquatic, and when it allows itself to go full-blown existential, it manages a sort of cinematic brilliance that it's rival blockbuster (Oppenheimer, of Oppenheimer, looming so large over everyone's attempt at pretension) simply can't manage. The film has deep flaws, but heart is not one of them.It's a magical thing to see Margot Robbie cry, and while her performance really isn't particularly consequential to the plot, it does present emotional heft to a screenplay that is both dullard and brilliant by design. Robbie, like Charlize Theron, is a beautiful blonde archetypal actress who just happens to be profoundly intelligent and intense, even when the film literally mentions exactly how we are not supposed to look at her as ""average"" while begging us to see her as just that. It's a neat trick to pull off a genuinely flattering disrobing of stereotypical beauty. It's a joke Robbie is in on, and a passive exclamation point that co-star Ryan Gosling owns.I like watching actors having fun onscreen. I actually never expected to experience this in Barbie, especially when it shoehorns in less-than interesting roles for Will Farrell and Kate McKinnon and quickly exhausts its post-subtlety messaging. Farrell and McKinnon are supposed to be two anarchical characters. Both fall flat. We've seen it all before, and here they lack any acidity whatsoever. Their roles feel tired after countless Toy Storys and Lego Movies treading on the politics of child/adult expectations of reality. They almost seem like add-ons from the corporate execs they lampoon - especially troubling in that McKinnon is supposed to represent anarchy. But Robbie and America Ferrera eat up the screen, both inhabiting a particular idea that seems to have genuinely spring from Gerwig's best instincts. There are scenes that - in an overwrought and exaggerated cinematic world - seem to actually exist in real life. To get caught by surprise seemed impossible as the first act ground to a halt.Barbie is a little too blunt for its own good, which strangely ends up being a good thing. At just under two hours, the bludgeoning messaging stops being funny and you feel the fatigue that we're supposed to understand is the source of Barbie's angst. In that, the ending isn't a reach so much as a confident nod to where Gerwig has taken the audience. If it's rare to see a actresses having fun in a Hollywood film, it's especially rare to see a female director genuinely flourishing by being just exactly who she is.",awkward brilliant antipopcorn movi,the surpris thing barbi joke get old quickli then stop beat audienc head obvious settl selfassur groov it rare case third act actual better first two the joke land harder shed need thing twist neatli mirror film central crisi momentum play first half barbi surprisingli drab it feat product wink self refer threaten turn pain civic lesson gener everygenreallatonc lectur it nearli weird jar need ultim barbi world lifeless titular characterbut someth interest happen barbi actual start land punch it accid turn happen introduct fairli obviou twist introduct strang charact play rhea perlman and perlman perfect actress fill role she small unglamor croneish consist cast either venom tough matronli siev in barbi she liter choru exist film suggest know concess corpor barbi toy empir relationship mani woman themselvesthes topic long churn noah baumbach film combin topic defin gerwig featur yet movi doesnt work like anyth two accomplish separ barbi feel like ladybird way the life aquat allow go fullblown existenti manag sort cinemat brillianc rival blockbust oppenheim oppenheim loom larg everyon attempt pretens simpli cant manag the film deep flaw heart one themit magic thing see margot robbi cri perform realli isnt particularli consequenti plot present emot heft screenplay dullard brilliant design robbi like charliz theron beauti blond archetyp actress happen profoundli intellig intens even film liter mention exactli suppos look averag beg u see it neat trick pull genuin flatter disrob stereotyp beauti it joke robbi passiv exclam point costar ryan gosl ownsi like watch actor fun onscreen i actual never expect experi barbi especi shoehorn lessthan interest role will farrel kate mckinnon quickli exhaust postsubtleti messag farrel mckinnon suppos two anarch charact both fall flat weve seen lack acid whatsoev their role feel tire countless toy stori lego movi tread polit childadult expect realiti they almost seem like addon corpor exec lampoon especi troubl mckinnon suppos repres anarchi but robbi america ferrera eat screen inhabit particular idea seem genuin spring gerwig best instinct there scene overwrought exagger cinemat world seem actual exist real life to get caught surpris seem imposs first act ground haltbarbi littl blunt good strang end good thing at two hour bludgeon messag stop funni feel fatigu suppos understand sourc barbi angst in end isnt reach much confid nod gerwig taken audienc if rare see actress fun hollywood film especi rare see femal director genuin flourish exactli
Laughed and cried so much,"It is funny, it is deep, it is nostalgic, it is not about romance, it is all the things the doll was meant to be.The narrator states at the beginning that the reason the doll was conceived was to give girls a path different from motherhood, but somehow we ended up turning her into this shallow stereotype to crush women's self-esteem.The movie is entertaining , it makes you laugh, has so many characters, you barely get to appreciate all of them. I don't particularly love gosling as ken, I find him too old for the role, but plays well the part.Now the important thing about the movie is the concept. The whole idea of patriarchy being the ultimate cause for the existential crisis for both men and women is just beyond brilliant. It is light enough so you don't get an existencial crisis while watching it, but you'll leave the theater with a refreshed notion that we are all suffering due to the same problem.That scene with the old lady is endearing, the scene where barbie and ken are explaining how they are feeling about being observed on the street is an eye opener, and ohh, that final joke!

Not as clever as it thinks it is,"I went into the film having high expectations, the marketing for Barbie has been really effective, I have to give them that. I had also heard good things about the movie from friends and co-workers. So I went to the cinema with my friend, dressed in pink.I was expecting a funny, girly movie with some clever commentary on patriarchy and existentialism. Instead, I found it to be campy and over the top. Campy can be fun, and there were one or two chuckle-worthy moments. But I wouldn't describe it as a funny comedy. Maybe it's because we're from Northern Europe, but the audience certainly wasn't laughing at many moments. I recall Ryan Gosling causing a few chuckles here and there though, he's got great comedic timing.The social commentary wasn't very subtle, the message was overly clear. It was so exaggerated that I found myself cringing at the lines and scenes. It could've been done much more elegantly, but it's clear that they didn't have high expectations of their audiences' intelligence.But there were some highlights too, of course: Barbieland looked amazing and I loved the costume design. Ryan Gosling was lovable and funny, even as a loser Ken. Margot Robbie was convincing as Barbie. The music fit well.Lastly, I wish I had gone into the movie without any expectations. I probably would've enjoyed it more then. It was relatively entertaining but I don't think that I'll be rewatching it. As a feminist I was disappointed in how on the nose the social commentary was. It could've been done with so much more grace and respect for the audience's intelligence. I also didn't like the way the dialogue was written over all, it was very ""wannabe-intellectual"" which I didn't find to be very funny at all. Maybe it's just the American humor that doesn't suit me.",not clever think,i went film high expect market barbi realli effect i give i also heard good thing movi friend cowork so i went cinema friend dress pinki expect funni girli movi clever commentari patriarchi existenti instead i found campi top campi fun one two chuckleworthi moment but i wouldnt describ funni comedi mayb northern europ audienc certainli wasnt laugh mani moment i recal ryan gosl caus chuckl though he got great comed timingth social commentari wasnt subtl messag overli clear it exagger i found cring line scene it couldv done much elegantli clear didnt high expect audienc intelligencebut highlight cours barbieland look amaz i love costum design ryan gosl lovabl funni even loser ken margot robbi convinc barbi the music fit welllastli i wish i gone movi without expect i probabl wouldv enjoy it rel entertain i dont think ill rewatch a feminist i disappoint nose social commentari it couldv done much grace respect audienc intellig i also didnt like way dialogu written wannabeintellectu i didnt find funni mayb american humor doesnt suit
We are all Barbie,"Barbie it's not just a movie about some dolls and perfection. This movie says a lot about everything. In the first seconds of it I thought there wouldn't be something meaningful. I thought it would be some fun movie just to chill while you're watching it. But this movie is a lot more than just fun. With this movie we can see ourselves in it. It shows how powerful women are. But also how hard it is to be a woman. And not just that. Also our childhood. The barbieland is our childhood. Peaceful, enjoying life. But when it's our time to leave it, it's scary and new because that's the adult life. The finale scene shows us that to live is the most beautiful thing we can experience. And some people are stereotypical barbies who don't know how to live their life in the most human way. We are here to smile, cry and improve ourselves. But sometimes we get lost and need to find ourselves again. It's a cycle that we need to go through. This movie represents a lot of things not just one.

The audience flooded it more than its limit with a rate of 70/30 of females vs males.Let me be more results oriented.The movie was a rather hilarious with lots of funny scenes starting from the very start. Also think that he main scene in Barbie land was a place with plenty of plastic ware all highly magnified with real actors. She and Ken found a culture shock reaching the real world. Dialogues in the second half were quite deep giving a rather different moral then we cold expect raising the IQ of the movie until the end when barbie took a rather unexpected decision for her future life.

"The hype this year was fun, the actual movie less so.","I was largely disappointed with Barbie and only sat through it in the hope that it would finally live up to its hype. When the final credits rolled the only thing that came to mind was ""So that was it?"".The Barbie Land set design is sometimes incredible and worth a star alone, but the plot and execution of the movie were a huge let down. After a promising start with a few chuckles, it becomes bogged down with negativity and cynicism trying to pass as humor in the completely messy and manic second and third acts. The obnoxious whiny dialogue really lets it down.I'm usually a fan of these fantasy meet reality movies based on iconic characters from popular culture and found the more child friendly Peter Rabbit, Paddington and Smurfs movies to be more mature, coherent, very funny and touching for all ages. Expectations were the same for Barbie, but none of those feelings really surfaced. I do understand on reflection that Barbie was aimed mostly at older viewers (which was probably unfair on the many cinema going younger children), however the attempts at emotion it was trying to achieve for that demographic towards the end felt far too forced, syrupy and unconvincing.Two movies which came to mind while watching Barbie that have some parallels - especially during the LA escapade scenes - were The Brady Bunch movie and Very Brady Sequel from the 1990s. These are more than 25 years older, but are funnier, do a more effective job with the ""real world"" satire and unlike Barbie are worthy of a rewatch. I think it's time to dig those out again and be entertained.",the hype year fun actual movi le,i larg disappoint barbi sat hope would final live hype when final credit roll thing came mind so itth barbi land set design sometim incred worth star alon plot execut movi huge let after promis start chuckl becom bog neg cynic tri pas humor complet messi manic second third act the obnoxi whini dialogu realli let downim usual fan fantasi meet realiti movi base icon charact popular cultur found child friendli peter rabbit paddington smurf movi matur coher funni touch age expect barbi none feel realli surfac i understand reflect barbi aim mostli older viewer probabl unfair mani cinema go younger child howev attempt emot tri achiev demograph toward end felt far forc syrupi unconvincingtwo movi came mind watch barbi parallel especi la escapad scene the bradi bunch movi veri bradi sequel these year older funnier effect job real world satir unlik barbi worthi rewatch i think time dig entertain
More Than Meets The Eye,"The Margot Robbie/Ryan Gosling curiosity BARBIE is a subversive film. This Greta Gerwig directed move lures you in by presenting a farcical/satirical look at the pastel colored ""Barbieland"" and the myriad of outfits and ""golly-gosh"" goodness of the world of this iconic Mattel doll (and her boyfriend, Ken). Once you are comfortably settled into this world, you are transformed to the ""real world"" and the much deeper themes of a women's place in a patriarchal world.As another toy's slogan puts it, ""there's more than meets the eye"" to this film.And one should have expected something more than just a ""surfacey-fun"" film from the Writer/Director of such fare as LADYBIRD and FRANCES HA. Gerwing uses the stereotypes of Barbie and Ken to take a look at our society and the inherent hierarchy of the sexes while peeling back the layers of the key players to make them more than the plastic dolls they portray.And...it works surprisingly well for adults - not so much for kids.Margot Robbie, of course, is perfectly cast as the titular Barbie. She has the looks and the vacuous devil-may-care attitude of ""Stereotype Barbie"" and is a comfortable, pleasing entity to share this adventure with. But, with Gerwig's direction, Robbie's performance reveals, subtly, layer after layer until - at the end - we end up with a full fledged character and not just a living doll.Ryan Gosling is just as strong as Barbie's counterpart, Ken. He morphs from a Barbie worshipping boyfriend to something else once he encounters the real, male-dominated world. The BankofMarquis wondered why Gosling would agree to do a film that, on it's surface, appears to be a one-note joke-fest, but once the film really drives to it's point, one can see why Gosling agreed to be in this.Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Simu Liu, Michael Cerra, Helen Mirren (as the narrator) and America Ferrara all spark - at times - during this film while it was good to see Rhea Perlman (Carla on CHEERS) have a role that she could sink her teeth into.Only Will Ferrell - as the money hungry CEO of Mattel - falls short of interesting. His character - one of the only ""real world"" characters in this film - stays stereotypical throughout the movie. He is the only complete caricature in this film...and perhaps that is on purpose.Credit for the surprising depth of this film goes to Gerwig who brings her sensibilities to this film to make a comment on our society. It's a bold move by Gerwig and works well...unless you are a Mom that is bringing your 5 or 6 year old child to this film.And, that is the caution to this movie. It's not, necessarily, made for the youngsters that play with Barbies. The kids will love the early going of this film, but the more adult themes in the middle of the movie will probably make a good deal of them squirm in their seats, since these moments of depth will go over their heads.A surprisingly fun...and deeper than it appears to be....film, this Barbie is a multi-level dreamhouse.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the BankofMarquis.",more than meet the eye,the margot robbieryan gosl curio barbi subvers film thi greta gerwig direct move lure present farcicalsatir look pastel color barbieland myriad outfit gollygosh good world icon mattel doll boyfriend ken onc comfort settl world transform real world much deeper theme woman place patriarch worlda anoth toy slogan put there meet eye filmand one expect someth surfaceyfun film writerdirector fare ladybird franc ha gerw use stereotyp barbi ken take look societi inher hierarchi sex peel back layer key player make plastic doll portrayandit work surprisingli well adult much kidsmargot robbi cours perfectli cast titular barbi she look vacuou devilmaycar attitud stereotyp barbi comfort plea entiti share adventur but gerwig direct robbi perform reveal subtli layer layer end end full fledg charact live dollryan gosl strong barbi counterpart ken he morph barbi worship boyfriend someth el encount real maledomin world the bankofmarqui wonder gosl would agre film surfac appear onenot jokefest film realli drive point one see gosl agre thisissa rae kate mckinnon simu liu michael cerra helen mirren narrat america ferrara spark time film good see rhea perlman carla cheer role could sink teeth intoonli will ferrel money hungri ceo mattel fall short interest hi charact one real world charact film stay stereotyp throughout movi he complet caricatur filmand perhap purposecredit surpris depth film goe gerwig bring sensibl film make comment societi it bold move gerwig work wellunless mom bring year old child filmand caution movi it necessarili made youngster play barbi the kid love earli go film adult theme middl movi probabl make good deal squirm seat sinc moment depth go headsa surprisingli funand deeper appear befilm barbi multilevel dreamhouselett grade a star take bankofmarqui
I actually enjoyed it,"Barbie is the latest toy turned movie adapation and stars Margot Robbie(Birds of Prey),Ryan Gosling(La La Land),Alexandra Ship(A Dogs Way Home),Dua Lipa,Will Ferrell(Elf),America Ferrara(Ugly Betty)and Helen Mirren(Shazam Fury Of The Gods) as the narrator.The story follows Barbie(Robbie) who notices strange things happening to her. She thinks about death,her feet are flat and she shows emotions. So she decides to go to weird Barbie (Kate McKennon) for advice and travels to the real world to find her owner Gloria(Ferrara) and her daughter Sasha to find out why she is malfunctioning. But will Barbie choose the real world or the plastic land of Barbie Land?.Overall I actually liked this film .Yes it's very silly and stupid but it was entertaining. Ryan Gosling was hysterical as Ken who is obsessed with horses and prospecy and the other guys as Ken including new Dr Who Ncuti and Secret Invasion star Kingston Ben Adir and Michael Cena as Allan. I guess if I had to change anything it would be for Barbie to stay in the human world more and actually have them as actual Barbie dolls first like Life Size or even Enchanted animated.If you loved Elf(since Will Ferrell stars in both films and the setting mirrors it too) and The Lego Movie along with adding sexual innuendo and woman's rights along with men's rights then you'll enjoy it.

"Overrated, could have been much better","Barbie is really not a good film. The IMDB rating is pretty flattering, although I have seen far worse films.In terms of what I liked; I thought the set design and colour scheme were nice. It did have a couple of funny moments.Other than that I can't praise the film too much. The acting isn't bad but the what was needed was good writing, which this film severely lacks. It's all over the place and doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.As a comedy movie it's not very funny, as mentioned I laughed maybe 2 or 3 times but overall it feels more like a drama. The message is deep and not befitting of a comedy film based off of a beloved children's toy. It is also quite long, nearly 2 hours in length, and it is not a very enjoyable experience in my opinion.Maybe I'm just not the target audience for this film, but I can't see too many positives about it.",overr could much better,barbi realli good film the imdb rate pretti flatter although i seen far wors filmsin term i like i thought set design colour scheme nice it coupl funni momentsoth i cant prais film much the act isnt bad need good write film sever lack it place doesnt seem know want bea comedi movi funni mention i laugh mayb time overal feel like drama the messag deep befit comedi film base belov child toy it also quit long nearli hour length enjoy experi opinionmayb im target audienc film i cant see mani posit
Creatively Brilliant,"Brilliantly written by Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. Everyone in this is fantastic. It's a wink at nostalgia and commentary on society. Never played with Barbies but my daughter did. Tribute to the inventor of Barbie, Ruth Handler. Helen Mirren narrates. Kate McKinnon almost steals the movie. Not a movie for little kids but most of the references will probably go over their heads. My girlfriend and I laughed out loud many times. It's about 20 minutes too long for my taste. The music is spot on. It's a perfect summer movie. Guess what? It has value and substance. Margot Robbie is not only gorgeous but more importantly, she's highly intelligent as actor and producer.

A Bit Over-Rated But Still Enjoyable,"My daughter came home from university for Christmas break and wanted to watch the Barbie movie so we rented it from Amazon and had a family movie night. It was better than I was expecting but in my opinion still a little bit over-rated. At almost two hours it was a bit long. The first hour was fun and had me laughing; the second hour - to me at least - started to drag a bit. But it's an enjoyable watch for the most part and leaves me shaking my head at the the right-wing menfolk who seemed to think this movie was the end of civilzation as we know it. That says more about their own sense of masculinity than about the quality of the movie.The cast (Margot Robbie was Barnie and Ryan Gosling was Ken) was likeable and funny. One way of cutting the over-long runtime would have been to cut out most of the scenes involving the fictional Mattel execs. I did not like them, most of their scenes seemed superfluous and it seemed just a way to give Will Ferrell an acting gig.But overall I'd give the movie a solid 7/10.",a bit overr but still enjoy,my daughter came home univers christma break want watch barbi movi rent amazon famili movi night it better i expect opinion still littl bit overr at almost two hour bit long the first hour fun laugh second hour least start drag bit but enjoy watch part leav shake head rightw menfolk seem think movi end civilz know that say sen masculin qualiti movieth cast margot robbi barni ryan gosl ken likeabl funni one way cut overlong runtim would cut scene involv fiction mattel exec i like scene seem superflu seem way give will ferrel act gigbut overal id give movi solid
Billion Dollar Barbie.,"I doubt this film will be remembered in 80 years. Its no Wizard of Oz. However, it caught the zeitgeist in the summer of 2023. And made its truly talented female director hugely bankable.Barbie (the beautiful Robbie) goes into the real world accompanied by Ken (an almost as beautiful Gosling) her ultimate fashion accessory, when she suffers from strange un Barbie like symptoms. Thoughts of death, flat feet etc. From there views on feminity and masculinity are explored and the everlasting tug of war and power shifts between men and women.Beautifully photographed with magnificent sets. Both will be nominated for Oscars. The leads are top notch, Robbie makes a stunning Barbie and Gosling a hilarious Ken.What Barbie has done has got people back into the cinemas and revitalised the film industry. For that alone it deserves 10. Well done.",billion dollar barbi,i doubt film rememb year it wizard oz howev caught zeitgeist summer and made truli talent femal director huge bankablebarbi beauti robbi goe real world accompani ken almost beauti gosl ultim fashion accessori suffer strang un barbi like symptom thought death flat foot etc from view femin masculin explor everlast tug war power shift men womenbeauti photograph magnific set both nomin oscar the lead top notch robbi make stun barbi gosl hilari kenwhat barbi done got peopl back cinema revitalis film industri for alon deserv well done
It's alright,"""If you brought a 7 year old girl to see this movie she would neither have fun nor be happy at all""
And this was my girlfriend's statement as soon as we left the cinema.I see it as an ok movie, occasionally very entertaining but overall chaotic, a bit cliché and even boring at times.Solid 6/10, i've seen worse but pales in comparison to The Lego Movie and other ""nostalgic intellectual property movies"" such as Mario Bros, which can contain deep messages without ruining the whole thing as I feel Barbie did.I have to give credit to the numerous exhilarating scenes with the Kens and the CEO, stereotyping done right IMHO.",it alright,if brought year old girl see movi would neither fun happi and girlfriend statement soon left cinemai see ok movi occasion entertain overal chaotic bit clich even bore timessolid ive seen wors pale comparison the lego movi nostalg intellectu properti movi mario bro contain deep messag without ruin whole thing i feel barbi didi give credit numer exhilar scene ken ceo stereotyp done right imho
Deeper than I thought.,"I really thought this would just be a cute movie, but it actually had a very deep message and I really hope people can take the messages away from this movie because there was a few. I think they did great with the Barbie movie. It was entertaining. The special effects were adorable, but the message was so HUGE in this movie.Watching these light fluffy cute reviews, I know most people missed it.First of all, Barbie was very empowering in her own world where she could be anything she wanted and looking her best while doing it AND the men were not needed, NOT IN CHARGE and all The Ken's cared about was whether or not, they received any attention from their Barbie
Sound familiar kept wives? Trophy Wives you have no other purpose except to look incredible for your stupid rich husband. That was Ken.The second she went into the real world. She was cat called had her ass slapped, got arrested for defending herself, and was treated with pretty privilege at the police station all while being treated like a blonde bimbo by people in the street. The complete opposite of Barbieland.I hope that people can take away from Barbie and Ken how the roles were reversed when they went from Barbieland to the real world and you could see Barbie becoming very anxious and self-conscious, while Ken became very self-confident, felt amazing he felt empowered immediately for the first time in his life, and you could almost see him go from proud to being a man to toxic masculinity within one scene.The teen angst was a good part too. Barbie was empowering to millions of girls but not to everybody. She has also given millions a very severe complex about body image, pretty privilege and society accepting them only if they look a certain way and Barbieland totally emphasizes that.Even the biggest Barbie was well done up. Dresses well hair done speaks delicately.Everyone there was picture perfect. Dainty and feminine. Even the Supreme Court were beauty pageant champions.This movie is actually deeper than I thought it would be. It was really good I really like Margot Robbie I think she's absolutely adorable as Barbie and I felt bad for her for most of the movie because she went from being a brilliant, beautiful and inspiring idol to some cat called bimbo with pretty privilege in the real world that they wanted to just put in a box.",deeper i thought,i realli thought would cute movi actual deep messag i realli hope peopl take messag away movi i think great barbi movi it entertain the special effect ador messag huge moviewatch light fluffi cute review i know peopl miss itfirst barbi empow world could anyth want look best and men need not in charg the ken care whether receiv attent barbi sound familiar kept wive trophi wive purpos except look incred stupid rich husband that kenth second went real world she cat call as slap got arrest defend treat pretti privileg polic station treat like blond bimbo peopl street the complet opposit barbielandi hope peopl take away barbi ken role revers went barbieland real world could see barbi becom anxiou selfconsci ken becam selfconfid felt amaz felt empow immedi first time life could almost see go proud man toxic masculin within one sceneth teen angst good part barbi empow million girl everybodi she also given million sever complex bodi imag pretti privileg societi accept look certain way barbieland total emphas thateven biggest barbi well done dress well hair done speak delicatelyeveryon pictur perfect dainti feminin even suprem court beauti pageant championsthi movi actual deeper i thought would it realli good i realli like margot robbi i think she absolut ador barbi i felt bad movi went brilliant beauti inspir idol cat call bimbo pretti privileg real world want put box
I don't get all the hype...,"This movie is many things. One may say it is a story of strength, and finding the beauty in yourself. Others, may just not like it. I am in the middle of all of that. The movie was a little better than meh, but lacked in some aspects that it could have dealt with more. I think Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were good, but I really didn't like their characters (Mostly Ken) The musical numbers and camera work were amazing. But, by far three things stood out to me. One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful. I enjoyed Superstore quite a bit and wanted to see Barbie mainly for her character. Her speech was moving and she brought so much to her simple, yet relatable mom.",i dont get hype,thi movi mani thing one may say stori strength find beauti other may like i middl the movi littl better meh lack aspect could dealt i think margot robbi ryan gosl good i realli didnt like charact mostli ken the music number camera work amaz but far three thing stood one costum design set the director sculpt amaz set design color costum go along my honor mention rhea perlman i thought phenomen while anyon could play role realli brought final america ferrara sinc day ugli betti becam household name but movi wonder i enjoy superstor quit bit want see barbi mainli charact her speech move brought much simpl yet relat mom
Disappointing and misleading,"The movie starts great, but goes off the rails soon after. Had they kept the look and feel of the first 30 minutes, this movie could've been great.For positives, the cast is great in general. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling do a great job as ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and Ken. Barbieland also looks vividly colorful and full of references to the toys themselves anyone who played with Barbie toys will recognize.For negatives, It is not a fun movie at its core. The movie pits women against men and it has a negative and political messaging. It's a ""lecturing feminist"" and ""bring down the patriarchy"" kind of movie. I wasn't expecting it to turn out this way from the trailers and was honestly surprised by it.In general, if you're looking for a lighthearted movie about Barbies (and Kens) where you can kick back, relax and have some laughs, this movie is not it.",disappoint mislead,the movi start great goe rail soon had kept look feel first minut movi couldv greatfor posit cast great gener margot robbi ryan gosl great job stereotyp barbi ken barbieland also look vividli color full refer toy anyon play barbi toy recognizefor neg it fun movi core the movi pit woman men neg polit messag it lectur feminist bring patriarchi kind movi i wasnt expect turn way trailer honestli surpris itin gener your look lightheart movi barbi ken kick back relax laugh movi
It's beautiful.,"This one reminds me of why I love movies so much. Acting, dancing, visual arts, screenplay, plots, soundtracks, humor, moral, there are everything we need in a movie. What hit me the most is that I was only expecting the kind of adult humor in that Barbie song ""You can brush my hair undress me everywhere,"" but at some point I realize it's way more than that. The movie was hilarious that I remember my mouth was opened laughing the whole time you know, all the Barbie jokes. And it's so cute that just right at the beginning of the movie, I instantly fell back to my childhood memories and everything is pink it's so beautiful. Yet, it's such a deep movie that it told things we almost be numb to. It said it out loud to remind us who we are and what are our worth and where are we going and everything. It's a movie about love. I cried so hard and laughed so hard.

Had some good moments but that's it,"I found the movie to be refreshing, but it's far from perfect.Ryan Gosling's performance was the best thing about the movie. His sequences were the most memorable for me, which is something I never expected myself to say. His character, Ken, also happened to be well written.On the other hand, Barbie was a disappointing character. Margot Robbie was good enough. Even though there was nothing special about her performance, she wasn't the problem. It's just her arc was weakly written. The motivations used to drive the story forward were fragile and questionable. Her development at the end did not make sense. She wanted to become a human yet she only experienced the real world for like a few hours, during which she didn't go through any challenges or experiences to reach such conclusion in the end. She didn't even save the day; her owner did. It felt like Barbie was a supporting character in her own movie.Ken stole the show for the most part. Also, the song ""I'm just Ken"" should be nominated for the academy's ""Best Original Song"" award. It's just very catchy and the transitions in the song are very creative.The story overall could have been better.",had good moment that,i found movi refresh far perfectryan gosl perform best thing movi hi sequenc memor someth i never expect say hi charact ken also happen well writtenon hand barbi disappoint charact margot robbi good enough even though noth special perform wasnt problem it arc weakli written the motiv use drive stori forward fragil question her develop end make sen she want becom human yet experienc real world like hour didnt go challeng experi reach conclus end she didnt even save day owner it felt like barbi support charact movieken stole show part also song im ken nomin academi best origin song award it catchi transit song creativeth stori overal could better
Started out well but puttered out,"I was excited by the hype from this movie. It seemed early reviews were enthusiastic about the themes and tone of the movie. The first 30 minutes were slow, the middle frenetic, and the last boring.It seemed like it just drags and I still doesn't seem to have a cohesive message and some of the characters really had no contribution or purpose. I was sorely disappointed. Over-hyped, and unsurprising my wife even fell asleep.... My teens left without a sense of what the story was. It was jumbled and I feel reviewers are praising it for the sake of praising a female empowering movie but those have been done much better before and without being tacky.",start well putter,i excit hype movi it seem earli review enthusiast theme tone movi the first minut slow middl frenet last boringit seem like drag i still doesnt seem cohes messag charact realli contribut purpos i sore disappoint overhyp unsurpris wife even fell asleep my teen left without sen stori it jumbl i feel review prais sake prais femal empow movi done much better without tacki
Watch this!,"""I'm just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us. And if all of that is also true for a doll...""Bro I was so excited just to look at the beautiful painted sets and watch the beautiful Barbies and Kens wear goofy clothes...but this was a deep movie.The seemingly perfect matriarchal world of Barbie has has a sudden setback when the perfectly Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie)'s heels land flatly on the ground.Barbie has to leave Barbieland through a surreal theatrical series of vehicles to wind up in California, where she meets her creators at Mattel and others.Of course Mattel, one of the producers, wanted to paint themselves in a positive light. They probably over-emphasize their importance in the playroom (They assert Barbie was the first doll to not be a baby doll, the first opportunity little girls had to play at being something other than a mother, which I find hard to believe). But there is definitely some honest criticism in the movie of who Barbie is and what she represents. Does Barbie make women feel bad about their bodies? Maybe.There are also a couple very playful moments where it feels almost like it feels when one plays with toys. Made me think of the Lego Movie (Which also had Will Ferrell in it).Then there's the characters. There is humor. There is music. There are of, course, gorgeous people and sets. But most of all, there is self-actualization and growth.I love every line in this film. I keep thinking about it. I've seen the movie twice now and I hope to see it again. Please watch it.

Too much social commentary not enough Barbie,"I knew this was going to be political going in but I thought its Barbie so I could overlook it. But it was too much, I do not enjoy politics in movies, whether it's left or right. I expected it to be more fun, and feel good, and it was for some parts but not enough at all. Ryan was great and so was Margot but I did not understand why Barbie didn't like Ken, it's wildly known that Barbie loves Ken and Ken loves Barbie, it's iconic and it made no sense for everything else in Barbie land to be accurate but not that. Another problem was the writing it was very ""told and not shown"" as well as wordy. The scenery was great as well as the costumes, but the story could have been so much better. Like Barbie and Ken take L. A. on a fun adventure and some self-discovery but it wasn't really like that.

She's everything! He's just Ken.,"Fantastic movie! The writing and storyline is so much deeper than I could have imagined for a Barbie movie.

It's smart, funny, clever, deep, thoughtful, etc. I was actually in tears during the America Ferrera monolog. These actors are all amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling were the perfect Barbie and Ken. The music was amazingly hilarious. The Ken battle scene cracked me up so much. Greta Gerwig is a phenomenal.

Good Enough,"Barbie is a fun summery movie for all ages.It tells the story of the doll Barbie who has to go into the real world to find her girl owner after she starts behaving oddly for a Barbie doll. That is the main prompt of the movie, which quickly takes a new turn all together, focusing on Ken and turning the tables on gender and how men and women are presented in films and in art in general (not to mention how their are treated in real world). That social commentary was spot on, under the light of more comical lences that makes it more appetizing and easily digestable. However, the movie does get close to being over preachy, loosing its initial main idea. That could have been solved by making the movie a little longer, giving the plot space to smoothly develop and have all those features handled in a better way. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't have that, thus, the result is an overstuffy, half baked plot.On the other hand, the performances were enjoyable, with Gosling trully shining in this one. The mood and costumes were also spot on.",good enough,barbi fun summeri movi agesit tell stori doll barbi go real world find girl owner start behav oddli barbi doll that main prompt movi quickli take new turn togeth focus ken turn tabl gender men woman present film art gener mention treat real world that social commentari spot light comic lenc make appet easili digest howev movi get close preachi loo initi main idea that could solv make movi littl longer give plot space smoothli develop featur handl better way unfortun movi doesnt thu result overstuffi half bake ploton hand perform enjoy gosl trulli shine one the mood costum also spot
Exceeds Expectations,"If you told me a few years ago that one of the best movies in 2023, and arguably the highest-grossing one is going to be Barbie, I would have laughed and called you crazy. But here we are, and the atmosphere in the theatre felt like a cultural revolution, which can become ""You just had to be there"" moment for the Gen-Zs.Through the medium of this film, Greta Gerwig expresses the frustrations of all women, and at the same time presents a satirical take on patriarchy. The movie praises Barbie for being a feminist icon, but at the same acknowledges it's regressiveness. Ken is basically every man who embodies patriarchal ideals just for being rejected, as he feels accepted in the real world but gets ignored in the Barbieland, which was a stark reflection on how women feel in the real world. At the end, it has a beautiful message for all women.The script is genuinely funny with bucket-load of hilarious moments and lines. Ryan Gosling brings his A-game as Ken, saying that his expressions are hilarious would be an understatement. Ryan has basically understood the assignment. Margot Robbie was basically born to play the role of Barbie, as she fits into the role to a T. You can feel her as she is going through an existential crisis.The set-design and costumes were praiseworthy and clearly deserves an Oscar nod. The costumes of each Barbies and Kens have been designed so beautifully and intricately, that it bears a mention. The buildings in Barbieland have also been created with love and passion for the universe. The architecture of the movie is a visual treat for the audience.The cinematography of the film does a good job of presenting the Barbie with glitz and glitter. It is pink and completely unapologetic about it.The soundtrack is an icing on the cake. 'I am just Ken' is still stuck on my mind, as I am penning down this review. However, I do feel that the supporting cast was wasted, as thsy had very little to do.In conclusion, the movie is a popcorn-muncher but at the same time delivers a heartfelt message which is very important for the world.",exce expect,if told year ago one best movi arguabl highestgross one go barbi i would laugh call crazi but atmospher theatr felt like cultur revolut becom you moment genzsthrough medium film greta gerwig express frustrat woman time present satir take patriarchi the movi prais barbi feminist icon acknowledg regress ken basic everi man embodi patriarch ideal reject feel accept real world get ignor barbieland stark reflect woman feel real world at end beauti messag womenth script genuin funni bucketload hilari moment line ryan gosl bring agam ken say express hilari would understat ryan basic understood assign margot robbi basic born play role barbi fit role t you feel go existenti crisisth setdesign costum praiseworthi clearli deserv oscar nod the costum barbi ken design beauti intric bear mention the build barbieland also creat love passion univers the architectur movi visual treat audienceth cinematographi film good job present barbi glitz glitter it pink complet unapologet itth soundtrack ice cake i ken still stuck mind i pen review howev i feel support cast wast thsi littl doin conclus movi popcornmunch time deliv heartfelt messag import world
Half a Movie,"So much has been said about this film. It made huge amounts of money and had an incredible start at the box office. I wanted to see it, but the stars didn't align. Since I had read no reviews and had not talked to anyone who had seen it, I went in quite objectively. Our kids had a Barbie or two around the house, but they didn't rule their world. That said, I think I'm a pretty open minded movie viewer. This film is far from the phenomenon the press made it out to be. I enjoyed the incredible sets and recreations of the pink world. Also, the introduction to that world and all the Barbies and Kens was quite amazing. As others have said, however, is that it becomes wordy and preachy in the final third. I started looking at the clock which is not a good sign. The cast is good, although Ryan Gosling isn't dull enough to be Ken. He is never boring, even at the beginning. I'm glad I saw this because it is a cultural phenomenon (even though it doesn't deserve it). The message is a good one and spot on. It's just delivered in a less than stellar way.",half movi,so much said film it made huge amount money incred start box offic i want see star didnt align sinc i read review talk anyon seen i went quit object our kid barbi two around hous didnt rule world that said i think im pretti open mind movi viewer thi film far phenomenon press made i enjoy incred set recreat pink world also introduct world barbi ken quit amaz a other said howev becom wordi preachi final third i start look clock good sign the cast good although ryan gosl isnt dull enough ken he never bore even begin im glad i saw cultur phenomenon even though doesnt deserv the messag good one spot it deliv le stellar way
Even worse than conceivably possible,"I was expecting to hate it but I thought at least with all these millions and millions of people over praising it but alas it's worse than any movie made before it. Literally. Utter trash from the first second with indescribably unlikable characters. The beginning is a silly child's movie only to just turn deadly dull when it reaches the real World. I gave up before reaching the halfway point and just FF to the end to see how this dreadful, celluloid abomination would end but had to give up again before doing that. How anyone could see this once let alone several times has left me flabbergasted and flummoxed to the nth degree. I didn't even crack a smile once. As awful as anything can be. The title for worst movie ever made is completely cemented in my mind.",even wors conceiv possibl,i expect hate i thought least million million peopl prais ala wors movi made liter utter trash first second indescrib unlik charact the begin silli child movi turn deadli dull reach real world i gave reach halfway point ff end see dread celluloid abomin would end give how anyon could see let alon sever time left flabbergast flummox nth degre i didnt even crack smile a aw anyth the titl worst movi ever made complet cement mind
Historical Barbie Film,"As someone who played with the dolls growin up,the in-jokes and references to some rare Barbie variations and playsets are funny. The political message gives Barbie a new dimension I never thought would go to. I felt a hidden anti-war message in it actually which is deep for a toy I never thought would be taken that serious. Makes sense in order to explain the historical connotations about the franchise's history,but on rewatch I'll fast forward to the cheesy funny parts. Would I watch it again? Probably!!!!!!!! Especially after eating a pot cookie,bet this movie would look crazier!

One of a kind,"I am amazed at the enormous success of this film. I'm not implying that it is a bad movie, but it's just a fun film based on dolls. It certainly is different and kind of unique with a pretty wonderful opening along with a fascinating production design, but ya gotta love pink! It's all about feminism and patriarchy and it's a little heavy handed about both of those topics, but it makes its points. While it's not a great film, it took some great talent to make this odd idea work and I am referring specifically to Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach who provide some funny and witty moments. In my opinion, both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are both too old for their roles, but they pull it off quite well. While it looks and feels like a children's film some of the time since this is about dolls, it's message is for adults, though children would appreciate a lot of it without really getting it, so to speak.

Overhyped Mattel Commercial for Plastic Dolls,"I waited to see this on MAX to experience all the commotion, and if they never made the film ""Bolero,"" this would rank as the worst film ever made for me.From the DEI Barbies to the tack-on mean girl junior high school girls (btw, with the way I actually feel about these pieces of plastic), to the Barbie rules the world crap.Then they leave the playland and look at the real world, and Ken finds out it is not a secondary piece of plastic but a ruler of the world; tries to change their playland, and the Barbies revolt or something akin to it so all of this was boiled down to hogwash.The acting was..acting. I felt nothing for anything, and the preachy ending was overblown. And I thought Mattel had pasted together old 70s ""After School Special"" or ""Johnathan Livingston Seagull"" -ish clips to give some feeling. I got tired of hearing the Mattel brand name; it grew tiresome, and the accessories to the pieces of plastic they used as consumerism at its best. The only thing I liked was the end credits going through Mattel's plastic products associated with Barbie - and I loved seeing the dog that pooped.It didn't grab me; I didn't find it funny anywhere. It went from the most annoying opening to as far as one can get annoying in every second of this film. The music was shallow; the production design teetered on Terry Gilliam's work but without the imagination or talent, and old 1920s/1930s film backgrounds and old Three Stooges routines were very tiring.This film was not for me or my demographic; it is for Barbie lovers, and to be honest, when my mom bought me one, I set her blonde hair on fire and ran her over on my Big Wheel, so maybe that had something to do with it.I gave it a view through and can never honestly get that time back.

That has NEVER changed.Until THIS.And I bet you are thinking this review is satire. It's NOT.I'm BLOWN away. Barbie is now my favorite movie of all time - successfully unseating Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. I never thought I would see the day.The movie makes you think it's going to be just a fun, silly movie to mock. NO. It's not. It's brilliantly written. It's written so well that all the adult messaging goes right over the little kids heads but still gives them plenty of enjoyment.The movie sparked really great discussion with my daughter who is 8-years-old. We discussed why it's so important to value ourselves and what the patriarchy is. It's just... mind blowingly good.And also - a good reminder to all women. WE ARE ENOUGH. We are good enough.

Boring Movie,"Dont fall for the 5 star reviews. This movie is extremely boring and goes on without a purpose even if it has it's hard to understand.Good humour but when they don't have anything to say they sing songs. Basically a musical movie, reminds me of High School Musical.Margot Robbie is amzing but Ryan Gosling steals the show not with his looks but his acting. He's the one who was gripping the movie.

Kentastic!,"I honestly thought I have to see what the hype was all about but I'd go when the buzz has dies down but after not being able to get the ""I'm just Ken"" song out of my head for a couple of weeks I gave in and I'm glad I did...I really enjoyed it! This movie isn't just aimed at kids in fact I would say it was definitely more for adults funny enough. Ryan stole the performance for me as Ken I looked more forward to his scenes then anything else. He captured so much in his looks and expressions that he totally steals the show and barbie actually felt secondary to me which is ironic as Ken always felt second. It could have been named Ken actually I loved knowing more about him then Barbie. Margot Robbie was beautiful and definitely captured Barbie she is stunning. Will Farrel plays the same character I feel though I love him but anyone could have played his role as boss of Mattel. I would watch it again for sure and I would actually love it if ""I'm just Ken"" wins best song at the Oscars and Ryan gets to sing it. Overall I can't find much wrong with it my only complaint is the real world I found a little bit boring I much preferred the dreamworld. Also the Alan character was great I wish we saw more of him. I definitely highly recommend this movie it's an enjoyable watch and a great pick me up smile on face movie.",kentast,i honestli thought i see hype id go buzz die abl get im ken song head coupl week i gave im glad i didi realli enjoy thi movi isnt aim kid fact i would say definit adult funni enough ryan stole perform ken i look forward scene anyth el he captur much look express total steal show barbi actual felt secondari iron ken alway felt second it could name ken actual i love know barbi margot robbi beauti definit captur barbi stun will farrel play charact i feel though i love anyon could play role bos mattel i would watch sure i would actual love im ken win best song oscar ryan get sing overal i cant find much wrong complaint real world i found littl bit bore i much prefer dreamworld also alan charact great i wish saw i definit highli recommend movi enjoy watch great pick smile face movi
Very mixed,"The start was a wonderfully fun look at Barbies & Kens in Barbieland but I felt that it was a bit abrupt when Barbie out of nowhere had thoughts of death would've made more sense for her to notice signs of imperfection first then thoughts of death.Film doesn't hate men I actually really enjoyed how they handled Ken by showing how it is so easy for society to corrupt young teen men with people like Andrew Tate etc. Although ending was bad, why not have Kens and Barbies in charge together as going in the real world showed that men running it was bad & Barbieland was only a utopian for the Barbies. At one point Barbie is asked where do the Kens sleep and she thinks for a moment before saying ""I don't know"" then that's it we never learn, basically her saying ""I don't know and I don't care."" They did so well showing Ken's feelings of being inadequate, inferior and almost like a toy for Barbie to play with when she wanted and yet they just end with the Barbies taking back control of Barbieland, they give Ken's low level government jobs because they should struggle like woman. So, the message is it's okay for one gender to have to fight, claw and struggle for anything good as long as it's men?Also this is entire my own preference and has no fault of story but most of the cast was a bit rubbish for me anyway. It was as if the casting director watched some British shows and picked actors from, like did we really need 3 sex education actors all of which were pretty bland?",veri mix,the start wonder fun look barbi ken barbieland i felt bit abrupt barbi nowher thought death wouldv made sen notic sign imperfect first thought deathfilm doesnt hate men i actual realli enjoy handl ken show easi societi corrupt young teen men peopl like andrew tate etc although end bad ken barbi charg togeth go real world show men run bad barbieland utopian barbi at one point barbi ask ken sleep think moment say i dont know that never learn basic say i dont know i dont care they well show ken feel inadequ inferior almost like toy barbi play want yet end barbi take back control barbieland give ken low level govern job struggl like woman so messag okay one gender fight claw struggl anyth good long menalso entir prefer fault stori cast bit rubbish anyway it cast director watch british show pick actor like realli need sex educ actor pretti bland
Wildly Entertaining.,"Barbie surprised me in all the best ways. It was funny, moving, inspirational, and all around ridiculously entertaining. I mean that with every sense of the implication to.There were moments that everyone could relate to the film - at least as I observed, and it was heartfelt in delivery and message. Some of the narrator quirks delivered by Helen Mirren are just perfect and I found myself laughing more than anything else.There are so many nuanced things that make the movie so sweet but the best is probably the nod to the original creator of Barbie and the reason the doll was produced to start.",wildli entertain,barbi surpris best way it funni move inspir around ridicul entertain i mean everi sen implic tother moment everyon could relat film least i observ heartfelt deliveri messag some narrat quirk deliv helen mirren perfect i found laugh anyth elsether mani nuanc thing make movi sweet best probabl nod origin creator barbi reason doll produc start
"Weird, Funny And Thought Provoking","I saw Barbie, starring Margot Robbie-Babylon, the Suicide Squad movies; Ryan Gosling-Blade Runner 2049, La La Land; America Ferrera-Superstore_tv, Ugly Betty_tv; Kate McKinnon-SNL_tv, Ghostbusters_2016 and Will Ferrell-Holmes & Watson, the Daddy's Home movies.This is a weird, funny and thought provoking movie about a doll that was created in 1959 by Ruth Handler. Before the movie starts, there are several music videos with singers and stars from the film. The movie then goes straight to Barbie Land, where everything is pink-Barbie's favorite color-and everyone sings and dances a lot. Margot is the main Barbie-there are lots of them, of course, as well as Kens-and Ryan is the main Ken. Everything is going along like usual for Margo until she starts having visions of death and despair. The rest of the Barbies tell her to consult with Kate-the weird Barbie-and Kate tells her that she must go to the real world and find out the source of her problems. Ryan goes with her and they both discover that in the real world, it's not run by Barbies but instead by men. Will plays the CEO of Mattel and America is his secretary. There are messages about feminism and the role of the Barbie doll in shaping little girls' minds-both good and bad-and there are several cameos of actors you may recognize, as Ken and Barbie.It's rated PG-13 for some language and some sexual innuendo-mostly just jokes-and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes.Although I would probably not buy it on DVD, it is entertaining and would be a good one to stream.",weird funni and thought provok,i saw barbi star margot robbiebabylon suicid squad movi ryan goslingblad runner la la land america ferrerasuperstoretv ugli bettytv kate mckinnonsnltv ghostbust will ferrellholm watson daddi home moviesthi weird funni thought provok movi doll creat ruth handler befor movi start sever music video singer star film the movi goe straight barbi land everyth pinkbarbi favorit colorand everyon sing danc lot margot main barbiether lot cours well kensand ryan main ken everyth go along like usual margo start vision death despair the rest barbi tell consult kateth weird barbieand kate tell must go real world find sourc problem ryan goe discov real world run barbi instead men will play ceo mattel america secretari there messag femin role barbi doll shape littl girl mindsboth good badand sever cameo actor may recogn ken barbieit rate pg languag sexual innuendomostli jokesand run time hour minutesalthough i would probabl buy dvd entertain would good one stream
Overrated and sad,"I saw this recently on streaming after hearing so much hype about how it was so important and such an incredible movie. After I watched it I wondered if I'd ordered the wrong movie. The whole thing was just lame unfunny jokes, a convoluted plot line, bland acting and mixed messaging which seems to be trying to be positive for women but are unintentionally negative - especially at the end with how the Barbies trick the Kens, I mean is the positive message for my daughter meant to be to exploit men by buttering them up? Er what?Reviews for this were glowingly positive and I pretty much disagreed with all of them, but even the negative reviews praised the set design and Barbie land, personally I didn't see the big deal, like they copied how the dream houses look and made a set of it. Whoopty do.The two stars are mostly for Ryan Gosling and Allan (I forget the actors name) as they were the best part of the movie, even though Gosling Ken strolling was sad to me. Which is ironic given it was meant to be a movie about empowering women.Disappointing and I expect this movie to be re evaluated as bad in the future.",overr sad,i saw recent stream hear much hype import incred movi after i watch i wonder id order wrong movi the whole thing lame unfunni joke convolut plot line bland act mix messag seem tri posit woman unintent neg especi end barbi trick ken i mean posit messag daughter meant exploit men butter er whatreview glowingli posit i pretti much disagre even neg review prais set design barbi land person i didnt see big deal like copi dream hous look made set whoopti doth two star mostli ryan gosl allan i forget actor name best part movi even though gosl ken stroll sad which iron given meant movi empow womendisappoint i expect movi evalu bad futur
An Ode to the Love of Cinema,"Wow. I saw this movie on July 23rd and I've been thinking about it ever since. Right off the bat, the first thing that has to be mentioned is the absolutely stunning and wildly impressive set design. The backdrops, the houses, all of the set decoration in Barbieland is PERFECTION. All of the travel sequences are so fun and beautiful and creative. I would love to believe that Barbie can help usher in a new era, where we can go back to at least having some movie with real honest to god set design in a sound stage, without so much CGI. Set Dec is 10/10Next, I have to talk about Greta Gerwig's clear love of cinema. From the opening sequence that starts with a perfect 2001: A Space Odyssey parody which they absolutely nailed, to a hilarious Matrix reference, and then the overarching clear love of old Hollywood and especially those old school classic musicals. The dance and musical numbers here are just an absolute BLAST!Then there is the acting. It almost feels wrong to say it, but there's no denying that Ryan Gosling steals every scene he is in. His comedic timing is a triumph and the fact that we haven't gotten to experience more of this in his film history is a travesty. Margot Robbie is absolute perfection, the most obvious casting for Barbie ever in the history of the world, but don't let that fool you. Her balance between comedy and the emotional scenes are unmatched by anyone else here. She really is one of the best actor of this generation. The rest of the cast also absolutely kills it. America Ferrera Simu Liu, Kate McKinnon, Michael Cera, Will Farrell, etc etc etc, everyone holds their own in this incredible ensemble performance. Acting is 10/10THE MUSIC!!!! It is so iconic and obvious and perfect that we get a full original Barbie album for this film. I'm not always a hard pop music kind of person, but it went so perfectly with this film, that I had to order myself a vinyl copy. But best of all, Ryan Gosling's performance in ""I'm Just Ken."" The dance sequence in this one is so freaking fun and good and hilarious. I can only pray that it is nominated for Best Original Song at the Oscars so that we can be blessed with a live performance of this gem, can you imagine it?!? Music is 10/10And finally, the script. See how I managed to make it this far in the review without even bringing up what all of those insecure baby men on the internet seem to only be able to focus their tiny brains on? This script is hilarious, SO smart and witty, and deeply poignant and emotional. It hits home so hard on so many points while still being able to poke fun at this doll that has captivated the imagination of children for the last 64 years. I love that even though Barbie has caught some heat in the last decade or so for destroying the body image of women everywhere(I personally did not find that to be the case for me, I was perfectly happy to compare myself to all of the other fellow 10 year old girls in my age group to do that for me) we are able to also look at how the ambitions of this doll, all of her careers, the fact that there was an Astronaut Barbie before there was a woman working at NASA, etc. Then of course the dreaded wish to take down the patriarchy!! If anything in this movie seemed false or offended you, I don't even know what to tell you. This felt like a very real and true example of what its like to walk through this world as a woman. So many women have shared America Ferrera's monologue, and the entire set of scenes after that were some of the funniest scenes in the entire movie. And I say that as a big Matchbox Twenty fan!All in all, this movie for me is a masterpiece, it's stunning, hilarious, emotional and the most fun I may ever have had in a movie theatre.

Sly and litely amusing,"Greta Gerwig's mildly sly take on the doll myth works more on the margins than directly. Here, a ""Stereotypical Barbie"" (Margot Robbie) and a seemingly stock Ken (Ryan Gosling), end up questioning the standard Barbie myth.Of course, when it's a $150M feature (with an equal amount for advertising) based on a mega-brand toy, one can't expect a truly subversive film. Gerwig and co-writer Noah Baumbach mostly settle for some gentle barbs and lots of winks and nods right from the pre-credits sequence. The screenplay takes elements of Toy Story/Lego Movie, Stepford Wives/Don't Worry Darling/Get Out and the Pinocchio legend to tell it's tale. Most of the funnier bits are the asides.The most enjoyable aspect here is the candy-colored Barbie-land designed by Sarah Greenwood, outfitted by Jacqueline Durran and photographed by Rodrigo Prieto. The assortment of other Barbies and Kens including Alexandra Shipp, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae along with Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, John Cena and more also bring wide-eyed joy to their roles. Michael Cena is amusing as the Non-Ken, Allan.Less successful is the ""real world"" with the exception of America Ferrera and Ariana Greenblatt as a mother and daughter, and, most especially, Rhea Perlman as Ruth (although the movie fails to mention that she was not only a tax cheat, but also stole Barbie from a German doll). Curiously, once they enter Barbie-land, Greenblatt's Sasha loses much of her real-world bite. More damaging are Will Farrell and his hench-men from the Mattel corporation. They are simply low rent buffoons who add little save for padding out the running time. Occasionally, one is reminded of all those lesser SNL based films where a decent sketch is stretched out to feature length. It's clever if too on the nose and obvious most of the time. Nothing exemplifies this as Ferrera's monologue about how it's ""impossible to be a woman."" It's well written and beautifully delivered by the actress, but, it feels out of place in a movie where the wittiest and sharpest material up until then have been half-whispered digressions, winks and nods. It's the one time the subtext takes center stage and it sticks out all the more because of that.The ending is rather sweet. BARBIE is about as good as one could reasonably expect from a studio concoction with Gerwig et al.

Only for Margot Robbie.....,"This movie is specially for those who loves the character of barbie specially in childhood. This film is a treat for Barbie lovers because the way director has told the storyline by introducing a whole barbie world and their characters is interesting to watch. Specially MARGOT ROBBIE what and actress she is her looks, style, acting performances, dresses of barbie all are top notch. Margot Robbie is perfectly suited for this role because she is the only one carrying the whole movie throughout the end. From start to end the main highlight of the this film is Margot Robbie. I've only watched this film for her and she has proved that currently she is one of the best actress in Hollywood. When I talk about supporting cast RYAN GOSLING is the only one who has done justice to the character of Ken rest are just average. Story is the main disappointment of the film, Film starts on a good note with laughs and riot of chaos when Barbie enters into the real world but after a bit of time story get exaggerated and only focuses on the central character which is the drawback of the film and from that case movie doesn't get the chance to give space to the other important characters.

I fee sorry to those who fell in the Barbenheimer trap,"To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. The movie starts fine which is more or less what was advertised in the trailers where the setting was Barbie. That was kind of fun. The problem is that the second part is just a mess in pace, it tries tooooo hard to be funny. The main message of the movie would have been great if it had been delivered properly. It was nowhere close to be succint. All Pixar movies do a better job at making their point. And for me, the worst of all, is that it tried to be controversial so hard that it became stale and dull after some minutes since everything centered around the same topic.Movies should try to unite not divide. At least create some discussion rather than being a one-way discussion where the writer basically tells everything.Parents: Not recommended to bring kids, it is not for them. It can be dull and the jokes are not aimed at that audience.Despite all of these problems, it deserves points for the first 30 mins of the movie, and the aesthetic.",i fee sorri fell barbenheim trap,to say i disappoint understat the movi start fine le advertis trailer set barbi that kind fun the problem second part mess pace tri tooooo hard funni the main messag movi would great deliv properli it nowher close succint all pixar movi better job make point and worst tri controversi hard becam stale dull minut sinc everyth center around topicmovi tri unit divid at least creat discus rather oneway discus writer basic tell everythingpar not recommend bring kid it dull joke aim audiencedespit problem deserv point first min movi aesthet
Love it!,"When I think of what Greta Gerwig , Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling and the rest accomplished I can't believe it.There are so many ways this could have gone wrong but it ends up a culture phenomenon!Ryan Gosling has to be the most versatile actor working today. He's a later day Jack Lemmon. I can't wait to see what he does next.I love that it's a fun movie with deeper meaning. It's not strictly about women but it focuses on the impossible expectations placed on women.Ken represents what women often have be relegated to and searching for his own identity.Kate McKinnon's Barbie represents what women face when everyone decides they don't measure up but who do they all turn to to fix things? .
Allan is the overlooked one which many can identify with.

"Witty, funny but severly sterotypical","A good laugh of a film poking fun at Mattel, complicating the concept of Barbie while at the same time highligting the patriarchy and it's inherent incompatibility with human emancipation.The irony is that the fillmmakers at the same time found it necessary to depict men in a insanely sterotypical fashion. One might argue this is not the case since it is mostly Ken's that are depicted this way. But since the Ken's behaviour are supposed to reflect the human female's experiences of men in general, that argument falls flat.In Short, enjoyable film, but as a discussion on the shortcomings of our present patriarchal society it is disappointing.",witti funni severli sterotyp,a good laugh film poke fun mattel complic concept barbi time highligt patriarchi inher incompat human emancipationth ironi fillmmak time found necessari depict men insan sterotyp fashion one might argu case sinc mostli ken depict way but sinc ken behaviour suppos reflect human femal experi men gener argument fall flatin short enjoy film discus shortcom present patriarch societi disappoint
Much Ado About Malibu...,"Finally stepped into the Barbie-verse with my wife and sons. The film is both simple and ambitious, which deftly allowed us to enjoy on a variety of levels. Probably best for you to see this before too long, and before you hear too much (indirectly or incorrectly) about the film imho.Plenty of humor, cinematography and music. Notably the humor is often taking a good look in the mirror and then making a self-deprecating joke. That is quite a trick mirror for the old notion of Barbie. All four in our family shed a few tears at times, the film's plastic fantastic elastic aspects cast aside, there's a sweet heart beating beneath it all.I'm not just talking about the ""you go girl"" vibe that one would expect and is definitely delivered. Ryan Gosling's Ken-ergy steals scenes but will he steal the vote in Barbieland? Personally, I don't buy the idea of this as an anti-man movie.Yet it is a feminist movie, built from a base of durable individuality.Another trick turned by this new Barbie is to take the old production line uniformity and humanize each of the many Barbies in this film. And yes, even Alan too!Tempted to title this review as ""God Bless America"" as America Ferrera nails the most vital message here in a wonderful monologue. Ferrera really is excellent in this. The movie could become a Mother's Day tradition in a lot of homes.You can find that monologue online along with so many other intricacies that went into this film, like who the lovely lady at the bus stop is in real life, and the fact that Margo Robbie via her Lucky Chap company chose Greta Gerwig and not vice-versa. That was a Frances A-Ha moment for me!The last line of the film was a different kind of a-ha moment, a touch or two of humor but also maybe the one uniting aspect for a very diverse Barbie-verse of feminists.",much ado about malibu,final step barbievers wife son the film simpl ambiti deftli allow u enjoy varieti level probabl best see long hear much indirectli incorrectli film imhoplenti humor cinematographi music notabl humor often take good look mirror make selfdeprec joke that quit trick mirror old notion barbi all four famili shed tear time film plastic fantast elast aspect cast asid there sweet heart beat beneath allim talk go girl vibe one would expect definit deliv ryan gosl kenergi steal scene steal vote barbieland person i dont buy idea antiman movieyet feminist movi built base durabl individualityanoth trick turn new barbi take old product line uniform human mani barbi film and ye even alan tootempt titl review god bless america america ferrera nail vital messag wonder monologu ferrera realli excel the movi could becom mother day tradit lot homesy find monologu onlin along mani intricaci went film like love ladi bu stop real life fact margo robbi via lucki chap compani chose greta gerwig viceversa that franc aha moment meth last line film differ kind aha moment touch two humor also mayb one unit aspect diver barbievers feminist
"Anyone Remember the Film ""Life Size""?","From a far, I can see why people would absolutely hate this movie. Just the concept of ""Barbie: The Movie"" is enough to make people feel like the art of cinema has been compromised by corporate America. But, as a whole, this movie was very well received. It made over a billion dollars at the box-office and was nominated for 8 Oscars including ""Best Picture"", so clearly it some people really liked it.There is a lot to enjoy in this film. The movie does a good job with poking fun at the Barbie brand without it feeling too much like a spoof. This is a comedy, so the fact that the film is really funny is kind of an important element. Understandably comedy is a subjective thing, so all I can say is for me, I laughed out loud several times through the movie. The movie is clever in how it treats its ""worldbuilding"" and nicely avoids any firm answers about how this world works. Because, yeah, if you think about that sort of stuff in the film there is a LOT that doesn't add up.It is nice that they don't spend too much time in ""the real world"" and focus on the creative fun of ""Barbie World"". The movie is more visually unique and can do more gags when that is the case.When the movie is focusing on being a bizarre comedy, that is when some of the best and most memorable things happen. When it tries to have a more serious message, that is where it loses some momentum. Don't misunderstand me, the movie needs some serious stuff in order to make the comedy work. And the stuff with Ugly Betty and her daughter is good emotional stuff. But towards the end, they realize that Barbie needs to have a character arc and feel like they tack one on last second. There are some very funny jokes towards the end, but it does become a little repetitive and the message feels heavy handed by the 5th time it's brought up. Side note: I wanted a cameo from the voice actress of Barbie, Kelly Sheridan, but she wasn't there.I will emphasize this because Hollywood will learn all the wrong lessons from this movie's success. We do not want a ""Polly Pocket"" movie or an ""Uno"" movie. What made this film a success, beyond its brand or its marketing campaign, is that it was uniquely Greta Gerwig's vision. The movie wasn't concerned with mass audience appeal, it would tell jokes that they thought were funny and hoped others would enjoy as well. If you want to duplicate Barbie's success, give creative people control to make some out there stuff.Wrapped in plastic, it's fantastic.",anyon rememb film life size,from far i see peopl would absolut hate movi just concept barbi the movi enough make peopl feel like art cinema compromis corpor america but whole movi well receiv it made billion dollar boxoffic nomin oscar includ best pictur clearli peopl realli like itther lot enjoy film the movi good job poke fun barbi brand without feel much like spoof thi comedi fact film realli funni kind import element understand comedi subject thing i say i laugh loud sever time movi the movi clever treat worldbuild nice avoid firm answer world work becaus yeah think sort stuff film lot doesnt add upit nice dont spend much time real world focu creativ fun barbi world the movi visual uniqu gag casewhen movi focus bizarr comedi best memor thing happen when tri seriou messag lose momentum dont misunderstand movi need seriou stuff order make comedi work and stuff ugli betti daughter good emot stuff but toward end realiz barbi need charact arc feel like tack one last second there funni joke toward end becom littl repetit messag feel heavi hand th time brought side note i want cameo voic actress barbi kelli sheridan wasnt therei emphas hollywood learn wrong lesson movi success we want polli pocket movi uno movi what made film success beyond brand market campaign uniqu greta gerwig vision the movi wasnt concern mass audienc appeal would tell joke thought funni hope other would enjoy well if want duplic barbi success give creativ peopl control make stuffwrap plastic fantast

ABUSE OF THE BARBIE,"Here's the thing.In my eyes BARBIE happens at the beginning of the movie. Amazingly created world with great looks and surprises now and then. Lovely! But then it feels like all about BARBIE is forgotten within seconds except for the pink color of course. The movie turns into a quite weird direction with happenings that are very sought and often don't make any sense at all. Suddenly everyone can jump around between two worlds and no one thinks that's crazy actually.Suddenly the difference between Kens, Barbies and Human beings is gone away ALTHOUGH in the beginning it shows definite differences like feet or fingers that aren't separate. Later on Ken plays the guitar and can move every single finger for example. All in all the great love for detail from the beginning is gone quite fast and turns into a long childish and boring battle between manly men and fimaly females. It starts to look like the TV-show Love Island. A loud unnecessary back and forth between genders. At the end a try of a deep scene to let go a few deep words and that's it. The movie teaches nothing to take home with. It's more like the name BARBIE was abused for this one in my eyes.",abus of the barbi,here thingin eye barbi happen begin movi amazingli creat world great look surpris love but feel like barbi forgotten within second except pink color cours the movi turn quit weird direct happen sought often dont make sen suddenli everyon jump around two world one think that crazi actuallysuddenli differ ken barbi human be gone away although begin show definit differ like foot finger arent separ later ken play guitar move everi singl finger exampl all great love detail begin gone quit fast turn long childish bore battl manli men fimali femal it start look like tvshow love island a loud unnecessari back forth gender at end tri deep scene let go deep word that the movi teach noth take home it like name barbi abus one eye
It would be nice if Barbie wasn't a children's character,"I know they're going to curse me, but I didn't think this film was as good as the rating it has here (7.0).The first 5 or 10 minutes (introduction) before the credits are wonderful, a very well thought out joke based on the introduction of ""2001: a space odyssey"", I got the feeling that a great film was coming. But it was pure illusion.First, I'd like to praise Margot Robbie's performance, truly sublime, she carries the film alone, as the rest leaves a lot to be desired. It leaves something to be desired as comedy, romance and fantasy, as a political, social and existentialist content, and, above all, as a children's film.I found the very inclusive cast excellent, but the ideological proposal of 90% adult fantasy, from the sarcastic jokes, through the existentialist issues of life and death, to the political and social themes, leaving the fantasy, lightness and romance in a plane below zero, everything in the film was made for a 14+ audience, well above Barbie's native audience. Not that I don't consider the themes interesting, yes, I like adult jokes and I value important gender and other agendas, and, yes, here in Barbie they should be included, but as subliminal themes to spark interest in a child, and not as an adult fantasy script.And why do I say that? Because my 5-year-old daughter, like many girls between 4 and 10 years old, has always been a fan of Barbie, she has watched all the cartoons more than 20 times each one, and when for the first time a live action version of the beloved doll appears, it's not made for children brains. It's difficult, for example, to explain to my daughter the fun of a joke about plastic and real vaginas and penises, or why Barbie melancholically philosophizes about death, or so many other things on that adult level of sarcasm that the film proposes. Disappointing.",it would nice barbi wasnt child charact,i know theyr go cur i didnt think film good rate the first minut introduct credit wonder well thought joke base introduct space odyssey i got feel great film come but pure illusionfirst id like prais margot robbi perform truli sublim carri film alon rest leav lot desir it leav someth desir comedi romanc fantasi polit social existentialist content child filmi found inclus cast excel ideolog propos adult fantasi sarcast joke existentialist issu life death polit social theme leav fantasi light romanc plane zero everyth film made audienc well barbi nativ audienc not i dont consid theme interest ye i like adult joke i valu import gender agenda ye barbi includ sublimin theme spark interest child adult fantasi scriptand i say becaus yearold daughter like mani girl year old alway fan barbi watch cartoon time one first time live action version belov doll appear made child brain it difficult exampl explain daughter fun joke plastic real vagina penis barbi melanchol philosoph death mani thing adult level sarcasm film propos disappoint
"It's Cute, But Definitely Overhyped","Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie. Of course she's incredibly beautiful, talented, funny, and hip; however, I didn't have some life-altering epiphany, like so many others did. I actually thought the film was way too cheesy, 45 minutes too long, and also confusing at times. I love the originality and strong feminist viewpoint, the idea of Ken learning about misogyny and sexism, essentially bringing these twisted ideas to Barbieland, leading all Barbies to succumb to a more subservient role, while ultimately forcing them to rediscover their own power, talents, intelligence, and individuality. But after an hour or so, I kept thinking, ""Why can't Barbie just sing a song?!"" I wanted a fluffier, comedic Barbie, while what I got was a doll having an existential crisis. It was depressing at times. The cast was phenomenal, of course. I just didn't expect it to be such a mess in terms of storytelling.",it cute but definit overhyp,margot robbi born play barbi of cours she incred beauti talent funni hip howev i didnt lifealt epiphani like mani other i actual thought film way cheesi minut long also confus time i love origin strong feminist viewpoint idea ken learn misogyni sexism essenti bring twist idea barbieland lead barbi succumb subservi role ultim forc rediscov power talent intellig individu but hour i kept think whi cant barbi sing song i want fluffier comed barbi i got doll existenti crisi it depress time the cast phenomen cours i didnt expect mess term storytel
"Barbie is fun, but gets too focused on the social commentary and does not do the plot justice.","Barbie was a very fun, light-hearted, over-the-top movie that takes you on a wild journey. The fact that it paid homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey's opening sequence earned it extra points for me! Ryan Gosling was great and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast, and the production design was fantastic. A comedy movie should mainly be judged on its comedy, and Barbie for the most part is actually quite funny! I also loved how the narrator speaks over the movie at certain points and delivers some funny lines. This may get some backlash, but I feel Barbie is a movie that earns popularity because it propagates feminist ideals and speaks to the issues women face today, and audiences are willing to look past its flaws to celebrate the movie because the message it portrays is very relevant in society today. I feel the same way with Sound of Freedom. Just because a movie talks about issues you care about, however important they may be, doesn't mean it's the ""greatest movie of all time"" and ""Oscar-worthy"" etc. The plot of Barbie seemed quite interesting to me, how Barbie goes into the real world and the chaos that could cause. But I feel like the movie got TOO drenched in the social commentary and thus didn't give the creative plot idea enough justice. Movies don't have to be so explicit with the social commentary, as shown by movies like 12 Angry Men (1957), which IMO does a far better job at tackling racism and prejudice than any film made today. At certain times, Barbie really blurred the line between being anti-patriarchy and being anti-men. It felt like it was fighting injustice with more injustice, although not throughout.",barbi fun get focus social commentari plot justic,barbi fun lightheart overthetop movi take wild journey the fact paid homag a space odyssey open sequenc earn extra point ryan gosl great margot robbi perfectli cast product design fantast a comedi movi mainli judg comedi barbi part actual quit funni i also love narrat speak movi certain point deliv funni line thi may get backlash i feel barbi movi earn popular propag feminist ideal speak issu woman face today audienc will look past flaw celebr movi messag portray relev societi today i feel way sound freedom just movi talk issu care howev import may doesnt mean greatest movi time oscarworthi etc the plot barbi seem quit interest barbi goe real world chao could caus but i feel like movi got too drench social commentari thu didnt give creativ plot idea enough justic movi dont explicit social commentari shown movi like angri men imo far better job tackl racism prejudic film made today at certain time barbi realli blur line antipatriarchi antimen it felt like fight injustic injustic although throughout
"Great for the ladies, but Kens stay away","Oppression is a state of mind, even when objectively you are oppressed.The biggest problem with this movie is that it leans HARD into both the feminist fantasy of oppression by MEN (as if we're some sort of ruling cabal who coordinates to keep all women subjugated-talk about intellectually lazy) AND the only acceptable man is an Allen (wimpy effeminate man). This movie could've provided a compelling argument for unifying the sexes, or how men and women complement each other, but NO. Instead in the final act, it chooses sides. And the side is comes down squarely on is the antagonist side, the ""equity"" side. The side of ""well, do unto others as you FEEL (in your hyper-oppressed feeling state) they've done unto you."" You feel like the Kens have done you wrong, so you oppress them in return. Never mind the Barbies oppressed the Kens for the entire time before the time period of the movie, and the entirety of the first act. But no, the Kens get out of line for the second act so they must pay. Equity demands retribution, so all men, excuse me, Kens, must pay.While I laughed and enjoyed the first two acts, in the end I felt thoroughly disappointed, angry, nauseated. If they had finished the movie as brilliantly as it began it would've been a 10/10, but they couldn't resist making it propaganda. I guess the joke's on me for taking our girls to it.Also, there's a monologue in the third act which could've been BRILLIANT, if the writers had been enlightened enough to recognize that that is how ALL HUMANS feel (not just women, men too). Every man I've ever known has feel the weight of crushing expectations from society, from women, from other men. It's not just a woman thing.Oh and then the last 5-10 minutes or so were... almost like a different movie. It just didn't line up with who Barbie was, and what this movie was about for that particular ending to occur.In the end, THIS KEN (me) cannot recommend this film to other Kens. Unless you're the kind of liberal / progressive man who believes the whole ""women are oppressed"" narrative. Then you'll probably love it. Every other guy though? Or the women who love them? I'd recommend taking a pass on this one. Or watch the first 75% and then leave.Bottom line this is every bit as ""toxic"" as some forms of masculinity. This is just ""toxic feminism."" And I say that as a feminist.",great ladi ken stay away,oppress state mind even object oppressedth biggest problem movi lean hard feminist fantasi oppress men sort rule cabal coordin keep woman subjugatedtalk intellectu lazi and accept man allen wimpi effemin man thi movi couldv provid compel argument unifi sex men woman complement no instead final act choos side and side come squar antagonist side equiti side the side well unto other feel hyperoppress feel state theyv done unto you feel like ken done wrong oppress return never mind barbi oppress ken entir time time period movi entireti first act but ken get line second act must pay equiti demand retribut men excus ken must paywhil i laugh enjoy first two act end i felt thoroughli disappoint angri nauseat if finish movi brilliantli began wouldv couldnt resist make propaganda i guess joke take girl italso there monologu third act couldv brilliant writer enlighten enough recogn all human feel woman men everi man ive ever known feel weight crush expect societi woman men it woman thingoh last minut almost like differ movi it didnt line barbi movi particular end occurin end thi ken recommend film ken unless your kind liber progress man believ whole woman oppress narr then youll probabl love everi guy though or woman love id recommend take pas one or watch first leavebottom line everi bit toxic form masculin thi toxic femin and i say feminist
Barbie is life,"I watched this movie expecting something else, but after the movie was finished I was not expecting so much humor, emotional rollercoasters, and a lot of Barbies with Kens. The last scene where Barbie wants to be a human had me almost in tears. I felt different in the heart as well. The soundtrack was also amazing as well. I just wish that there could be more Barbies for like everyday life that we go through and maybe it can get more sales. If not ""Blame Mattel"" lol. The Mattel jokes had me laughing every time they were brought up. I couldn't have asked for a better comedy movie for the summer.",barbi life,i watch movi expect someth el movi finish i expect much humor emot rollercoast lot barbi ken the last scene barbi want human almost tear i felt differ heart well the soundtrack also amaz well i wish could barbi like everyday life go mayb get sale if blame mattel lol the mattel joke laugh everi time brought i couldnt ask better comedi movi summer
"Disturbing, but I couldn't turn away","This is a very bizarre, very weird movie. Basically Ken gets motivated by the idea of the patriarchy once he visits the real world but only went to the real world because of Barbie, who was there because of the woman that still plays with Barbie was depressed and, yeah, whatever. Oh and Mattel is run completely by men.I always wondered what a Barbie films storyline would look like. But this makes Barbie sound like a diversion to play into the fantasies of progressive, feminist, women. And maybe it is maybe it isn't. Mattel is making a serious case for the legitimacy and relevancy of Barbie, and the movie is really a two hour commercial for the toy. But it's worth it to explore dynamics between women and men. Who is in control of relationships, how men and women really need each other for more than just families and reproduction.In doing so we are back to the patriarchy and old fashioned traditional all American values but maybe that is all that life was ever about anyway. But then when the movie makes its point it gets away from itself, runs too long and gets campy again.The bigger picture is that Barbie, the film, gives us that movie magic we took for granted. And that's why I think it was so successful. It gives us something that has been missing from cinema for a while. But it is still a mediocre movie. Seven out of 10 for transcending that mediocrity at different times, but only seven out of ten for it's rhetoric. If women are given a choice, they'll probably want to remain in Barbie Land.",disturb i couldnt turn away,thi bizarr weird movi basic ken get motiv idea patriarchi visit real world went real world barbi woman still play barbi depress yeah whatev oh mattel run complet meni alway wonder barbi film storylin would look like but make barbi sound like diver play fantasi progress feminist woman and mayb mayb isnt mattel make seriou case legitimaci relev barbi movi realli two hour commerci toy but worth explor dynam woman men who control relationship men woman realli need famili reproductionin back patriarchi old fashion tradit american valu mayb life ever anyway but movi make point get away run long get campi againth bigger pictur barbi film give u movi magic took grant and that i think success it give u someth miss cinema but still mediocr movi seven transcend mediocr differ time seven ten rhetor if woman given choic theyll probabl want remain barbi land
Had me smiling all the way through,"Okay maybe it was a 9.5 because of two flaws: First was the Will Ferrell character and his board that made their point but then became superfluos. Second was that it is definitely not a kids' movie (although maybe they would see things that I didn't - I mean to be fair, the few kids in the theatre were well behaved so perhaps the movie got their full attention as well).But why did I enjoy it? Simply amazing visuals, Margot Robbie looked flawlessly gorgeous and played it perfectly. Ryan Gosling was also brilliant in this. Great music, great pacing and then there was the script. There were a lot of messages in this film that trod a tightrope between pithy, ironic, sarcastic and cliched. But I reckon they just about managed it which, considering the subject matter, was quite an accomplishment. I will need to see it a second time to check whether the messages were balanced and as meaningful as they were meant to be but I hope that women were as upbeat about it as i was. Overall, on an enjoyment level alone, it deserves its high score from me.",had smile way,okay mayb two flaw first will ferrel charact board made point becam superfluo second definit kid movi although mayb would see thing i didnt i mean fair kid theatr well behav perhap movi got full attent wellbut i enjoy simpli amaz visual margot robbi look flawlessli gorgeou play perfectli ryan gosl also brilliant great music great pace script there lot messag film trod tightrop pithi iron sarcast clich but i reckon manag consid subject matter quit accomplish i need see second time check whether messag balanc meaning meant i hope woman upbeat overal enjoy level alon deserv high score
Surprisingly great,"Barbie the movie was much better and with more character, story quality and depth than I expected. I went into the movie to see what the fuss was about and for a bit of something fun to do and left feeling happy the rest of the day, thinking about its story a lot, the interesting execution and styling. I also played the soundtrack which has some great songs.To me movie turned out to not be preachy or about being feminist. I think the people who think so are misinterpreting that. At its heart, and this movie does have heart, it ties to Mattel's slogan and concept for Barbie products - You Can Be Anything. It's about finding out who you are and feeling empowered to be yourself, whatever that may be.It's a unique style of film and one I thoroughly found myself enjoying. I find myself wanting to see it again already.If you're in doubt whether to go and see this movie go, if you are like me and some other reviewers I've seen you may come away feeling glad you did.",surprisingli great,barbi movi much better charact stori qualiti depth i expect i went movi see fuss bit someth fun left feel happi rest day think stori lot interest execut style i also play soundtrack great songsto movi turn preachi feminist i think peopl think misinterpret at heart movi heart tie mattel slogan concept barbi product you can be anyth it find feel empow whatev may beit uniqu style film one i thoroughli found enjoy i find want see alreadyif your doubt whether go see movi go like review ive seen may come away feel glad
Good but not that good.,"The colors, shots, houses, clothes were really amazingly done. Margot and Rayan were amazing, beautiful and acted well. I will say that. I find that the movie wasn't THAT good. The story wasn't as entertaining as it could. This was supposed to be like a childrens show with adult humor and topics but I didnt find most of the jokes funny, i felt like they were just screaming stuff in your face instead of being more subtle. I wish some aspects of the characters and side stories were explored more. The ending was okay but i wished for something diffrent and again more about the side characters. Ken is a cool character i gotta say. He deserves the world and to really find something more about him. So i wouldn't say it was a bad movie, its okay to watch more casually, more so to appreciate the dolls and the nostalgia. I was lowkey dissapointment with all the hype i gotta say.Ps.

This isn't the movie you think it is - and it's probably better for it.,"Any time a movie prioritizes messaging, there's an all too long history of the end result suffering, whether in terms of its storytelling, its general craftsmanship, or both. Broadly, this trend holds true even when a message is important, admirable, and agreeable. Case in point, last year's slasher 'They/them' was troubled in various ways, but above all in how immensely upfront it was about its otherwise gratifying messaging; sure enough, the writing suffered in turn. This 2023 film is not free of that same issue, for it is extremely, emphatically forthright and downright strident about the ideas at the root of the screenplay and which it wishes to convey; they're terrific ideas, but literally from the very beginning we see and hear exactly, indisputably, what the script wants to communicate. More than that, this is a picture that strives to be, say, and do a lot, and in fact it is, says, and does so much that it's a little overwhelming - I earnestly think the finished product would have benefited from some thoughts being left out so as to tighten the whole and assert greater focus. And though I somewhat repeat myself, it's well worth accentuating that the feature is majorly heavy-handed, with astonishingly little of the content being given a delicate, nuanced touch for the viewer to pick up on or feel for ourselves. It's a title that wears its neon pink heart on its sleeve, and there's no possibility of missing it.And yet what's truly amazing is that for all this, 'Barbie' is also a movie that is incredibly, exceptionally smart. I can't readily think of any other title that was so predominantly blunt, gawky, and straightforward in its presentation, but which simultaneously impressed with the absolute supreme intelligence behind everything that's being shoved in our faces. Within the slant of being overfull and immoderate, it's nevertheless remarkably well-rounded and balanced. Everything it endeavors to be, say, and do is treated with that same frank hand, and all is blended together into a slurry where no facet is allowed to especially outshine the others. It bounces from trenchantly triumphant to awesomely artificial, to wildly wacky, to dourly dispiriting, to honestly heartfelt, to satisfyingly sincere, and back again, but the progression still feels natural and meaningful, not to mention purposeful, and we never experience whiplash. It is entirely unabashed about the values it wields like a flaming sword of vengeance, and the themes that serve as its very blood: feminism, independence, denunciation of patriarchy and toxic masculinity; self-discovery and self-realization outside any strict confines or definitions that are forced upon or underhandedly given to us, or which we unwittingly construct for ourselves; the need to be active agents of our own liberation, active defenders of what we wish to build, and active stewards of what we wish to maintain - and much, much more. Then, too, it plainly champions diversity even in just the casting, but ultimately acknowledges the advisable place and just importance of diversity, and equality, in governance and representation; touches upon the evils of capitalism, and also the multifaceted elements of what Mattel's signature doll represents, for good and for ill; recognizes that women, who can and should be anything they want, can be and may want to be mothers, too. It's not inaccurate to say that 'Barbie' acts to upholds what are commonly seen as leftist or humanist ideals, yet those who decry the feature as part of some subversive agenda either haven't actually seen it, or can't discern the immediately transparent notion that values that seek a better, more equitable world for everyone can only be said to be dangerous insofar as they threaten those values that work to sustain inequality and injustice.Meanwhile, setting aside the writing which is so enormously essential to all that this is, the film is stupendously well done in every other regard. The cast is a blast, simply put, obviously all having a fantastic time - but for as weird and widely varied as the parts and scenes may be, everyone also gives excellent performances no less worthy of appreciation than anything else that any of them have done. It rather goes without saying that Margot Robbie is altogether luminous as the stereotypical protagonist, but I personally am also very happy to see Hari Nef here so prominently, and Kate McKinnon is an outright joy. The crew put in magnificent work in every last regard, from spellbinding, colorful sets, to bewitching costume design, to impeccable hair and makeup, and more. Editing, cinematography, direction, sound, stunts, effects: I do not jest when I say that everything here looks fabulous. The music is a wonderfully fun garnish that I in no way anticipated, and all who contributed to the soundtrack in any way are to be congratulated; those instances of choreography that we see are utterly superb, providing a level of glee that I'd have never supposed even based on advance marketing. And as if all the huge, concrete ideas behind the screenplay weren't enough, the story in and of itself is genuinely entertaining and compelling, let alone highly rewarding. The scene writing is marvelously strong, rich, and varied, keeping the proceedings fresh and engaging from start to finish; the dialogue and characters are as shrewdly penned as anything else in these two hours. What here is not brilliant, when all is said and done? Well, I gave my answer when I first sat down, but even if it's not flawless, the imperfections here are less about any discrete weaknesses or shortcomings and more about how stunningly busy the script is, stuffed to the proverbial gills and nearly straining to keep itself together even in the face of so much skill and wit. And if that's the worst that I can say about a picture, then I'd say it's done darn well for itself indeed.The promise of a star-studded cast, filled with persons I admire, and the involvement of an esteemed filmmaker and her partner, did nothing to quell skepticism when news first surfaced of a live-action Barbie movie on the big screen. The first teaser and subsequent trailer elicited much favor, but still I had my reservations, wondering above all how the same dazzling energy could possibly be sustained for a full-length feature. Then, to be frank, there came the swift, abrasive reactions from certain people - reactions that were laughably alarmist and apoplectic, not to mention outlandish and unreasonable. Suffice to say that such breath-taking reactions were the tipping point for me, as they elevated Greta Gerwig's 'Barbie,' from ""a film I might like to check out if I have the chance,"" to a must-see. And now that I have? While all my doubts have been erased and I could hardly be more pleased, I can also safely say that this is not the movie I was expecting. That riotous energy of the teaser and trailer isn't here for the whole runtime (though, most of it, certainly). What we get as complement and in its place, though, is masterful mindfulness and craftsmanship, and a jarring, somewhat backhanded, but very welcome and refreshing, wholehearted sincerity that is all the more smarter for the ways in which, sights unseen, it's kept hidden. Ironically, I ponder if this isn't too lofty in its writing, possibly going over the heads of those who might benefit most from what it has to offer. Even if that's true, though, this is so splendidly well done that it will hold up indefinitely, and be something to revisit time and again, both for those who want to see what we may have missed before, and to ensure that its message reaches the widest possible audience. When I was younger I'd never have thought a Barbie flick could be this good and substantive, but here we are: Gerwig's picture is well worth watching, and earns my very high, hearty recommendation.",thi isnt movi think probabl better,ani time movi priorit messag there long histori end result suffer whether term storytel gener craftsmanship broadli trend hold true even messag import admir agreeabl case point last year slasher theythem troubl variou way immens upfront otherwis gratifi messag sure enough write suffer turn thi film free issu extrem emphat forthright downright strident idea root screenplay wish convey theyr terrif idea liter begin see hear exactli indisput script want commun more pictur strive say lot fact say much littl overwhelm i earnestli think finish product would benefit thought left tighten whole assert greater focu and though i somewhat repeat well worth accentu featur majorli heavyhand astonishingli littl content given delic nuanc touch viewer pick feel it titl wear neon pink heart sleev there possibl miss itand yet what truli amaz barbi also movi incred except smart i cant readili think titl predominantli blunt gawki straightforward present simultan impress absolut suprem intellig behind everyth that shove face within slant overful immoder nevertheless remark wellround balanc everyth endeavor say treat frank hand blend togeth slurri facet allow especi outshin other it bounc trenchantli triumphant awesom artifici wildli wacki dourli dispirit honestli heartfelt satisfyingli sincer back progress still feel natur meaning mention purpos never experi whiplash it entir unabash valu wield like flame sword vengeanc theme serv blood femin independ denunci patriarchi toxic masculin selfdiscoveri selfreal outsid strict confin definit forc upon underhandedli given u unwittingli construct need activ agent liber activ defend wish build activ steward wish maintain much much then plainli champion diver even cast ultim acknowledg advis place import diver equal govern represent touch upon evil capit also multifacet element mattel signatur doll repres good ill recogn woman anyth want may want mother it inaccur say barbi act uphold commonli seen leftist humanist ideal yet decri featur part subvers agenda either havent actual seen cant discern immedi transpar notion valu seek better equit world everyon said danger insofar threaten valu work sustain inequ injusticemeanwhil set asid write enorm essenti film stupend well done everi regard the cast blast simpli put obvious fantast time weird wide vari part scene may everyon also give excel perform le worthi appreci anyth el done it rather goe without say margot robbi altogeth lumin stereotyp protagonist i person also happi see hari nef promin kate mckinnon outright joy the crew put magnific work everi last regard spellbind color set bewitch costum design impecc hair makeup edit cinematographi direct sound stunt effect i jest i say everyth look fabul the music wonder fun garnish i way anticip contribut soundtrack way congratul instanc choreographi see utterli superb provid level glee id never suppos even base advanc market and huge concret idea behind screenplay werent enough stori genuin entertain compel let alon highli reward the scene write marvel strong rich vari keep proceed fresh engag start finish dialogu charact shrewdli pen anyth el two hour what brilliant said done well i gave answer i first sat even flawless imperfect le discret weak shortcom stunningli busi script stuf proverbi gill nearli strain keep togeth even face much skill wit and that worst i say pictur id say done darn well indeedth promis starstud cast fill person i admir involv esteem filmmak partner noth quell skeptic news first surfac liveact barbi movi big screen the first teaser subsequ trailer elicit much favor still i reserv wonder dazzl energi could possibl sustain fulllength featur then frank came swift abras reaction certain peopl reaction laughabl alarmist apoplect mention outlandish unreason suffic say breathtak reaction tip point elev greta gerwig barbi film i might like check i chanc mustse and i while doubt era i could hardli plea i also safe say movi i expect that riotou energi teaser trailer isnt whole runtim though certainli what get complement place though master mind craftsmanship jar somewhat backhand welcom refresh wholeheart sincer smarter way sight unseen kept hidden iron i ponder isnt lofti write possibl go head might benefit offer even that true though splendidli well done hold indefinit someth revisit time want see may miss ensur messag reach widest possibl audienc when i younger id never thought barbi flick could good substant gerwig pictur well worth watch earn high hearti recommend
"Loved The Barbie Doll As A kid, Loved The Barbie Movie As An Adult","Barbie (2023) :
Movie Review -Barbie Review: Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie is a breezy, funny, pinky, and girly Ride Into Barbieland. These four soft adjectives are enough to describe the Barbie movie. Greta Gerwig takes us into Barbie land with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling to deliver a possible fantasy that we all dreamed of as children or as adults. Being a boy, I couldn't have a Barbie doll in my childhood, but I did have a close look at her with my female cousins playing with her, doing make-up, dress-up, and all the girly stuff. And I don't think any boy is unaware of Barbie and Ken, even if he hasn't played with them in childhood. It's a fascination for us and a dream come true for girls. I am not at all hesitant to admit that if I were a girl, I would have enjoyed this movie more than I actually did as a boy. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it, and that's more than enough for today's social media gender ego system.Barbie begins with the inception of Barbie and how she appeared on earth (if we call it that in this fantasy movie). This very scene is a lot of fun when you see Margot Robbie appearing in black and white checks in one piece and little girls breaking their dolls into pieces. Soon, we are transported into Barbie Land, where all Barbies are living happily. All the women are self-confident, working in top positions, successful, and enjoying life to the fullest, while all Kens are jobless and do nothing but try to mingle with barbies. Our stereotypical Barbie (Robbie) suddenly begins to dysfunction and sense the morality of human life. She has to travel to the human world to find out who the child is who is calling her to be there. Obviously, Ken (Gosling) forces his company on her. However, things go wrong for Barbie in the real world, where she realises she is not loved anymore, whereas Ken finds a motto of patriarchy. Ken returns and takes over Barbieland by persuading other Kens and brainwashing the rest of the babies there. Here, distraught Barbie finds Gloria (America Ferrera), a Mattel employee, who is the catalyst of her existential crisis. Gloria began playing with her daughter Sasha's (Ariana Greenblatt) Barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to Stereotypical Barbie. Gloria restores Barbie, and then they take off on a mission to bring back all Barbies.It's been a while since we have seen a good-budget comedy movie, so Barbie certainly ends the dry spell. I mean, this one is a fun ride from start to end. It may be a little childish-oh, that's a bad word-let's say child-friendly, but it's damn funny. The humour is girlish, yes, but I liked it too. From Zack Snyder, The Godfather, cautionary note on Margot's casting to slapstick one-liners, Barbie is such a colourful comedy. It does not look like an intelligent film; rather, it stages itself as a crazy comedy. That's one of the points I'd say went wrong in the climax. These characters aren't supposed to be smart, but they intend to be when it comes to ending the show. Why? Pixar's Toy Story had the simple but subtle philosophy that a toy should be a toy for a lifetime. It may have many owners, but its job is to stick to them and be loyal, because that's why we humans love them. Barbie challenges this universally accepted theory and goes against the tide. Now, whether it's good or bad, I leave that choice to you since my personal opinion isn't very affirmative about this theory.Barbie was meant to be a career-defining role for Margot Robbie, and she made sure that you'd remember her forever as Barbie. I kept looking for a single frame where she would not look pretty, and I couldn't find it for 110 minutes. I melted, man. Ryan Gosling's Ken is the funniest character in the whole movie. That cute flirting, those reluctant expressions, jealousy, arrogance, and at last self-discovery-this man has lived the character. Kate McKinnon's weird Barbie appears for a short time but serves enough. Other babies, including Issa Rae, Hari Nef, Alexandra Shipp, Emma Mackay, Dua Lipa, Sharon Rooney, Ana Cruz Kayne, Ritu Arya, and Nicola Coughlan, are all gorgeous. On the other hand, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Scott Evans, Simu Liu, Rob Brydon, Ncuti Gatwa, and John Cena as Kens add fine support. Michael Cera, Ariana Greenblatt, and Will Ferrell pass the time well, while Rhea Perlman's cameo is blasting. The biggest cheer in the Barbie movie came for America Ferrera's monologue, which describes the struggle and victory of feminism. Ariana Greenblatt steals the show in the first, and the rest of the cast has done well.Made on a budget of $145 million, Barbie is a lavish big screen entertainer, as the production design makes sure you feel the fantasy right. Those fakish items could have been excluded, but having them there is kind of fun in itself. Who's to blame? Rodrigo Prieto's camera does the talking with close-ups and long shots of Barbie and Ken. Barbie does not have any loo breaks, courtesy of Nick Houy's superb editing, and the music is lovable. Some people often say that a female director and female lead's pair is something else, and I have to accept that Barbie could have been a lot less underwhelming without Greta Gerwig. This woman has made a world that is so adorable and so rummy. A few flaws are there in the script and the characters, but since we are not discussing an artistic masterpiece of cinema, let's Chuck that discussion. Let's enjoy this pinky and girly entertainer, which is sure to take female audiences by storm and leave a good enough impact on men too. Not to forget, who's writing it.RATING - 6/10*",love the barbi doll a a kid love the barbi movi a an adult,barbi movi review barbi review greta gerwig barbi movi breezi funni pinki girli ride into barbieland these four soft adject enough describ barbi movi greta gerwig take u barbi land margot robbi ryan gosl deliv possibl fantasi dream child adult be boy i couldnt barbi doll childhood i close look femal cousin play makeup dressup girli stuff and i dont think boy unawar barbi ken even hasnt play childhood it fascin u dream come true girl i hesit admit i girl i would enjoy movi i actual boy nevertheless i enjoy that enough today social medium gender ego systembarbi begin incept barbi appear earth call fantasi movi thi scene lot fun see margot robbi appear black white check one piec littl girl break doll piec soon transport barbi land barbi live happili all woman selfconfid work top posit success enjoy life fullest ken jobless noth tri mingl barbi our stereotyp barbi robbi suddenli begin dysfunct sen moral human life she travel human world find child call obvious ken gosl forc compani howev thing go wrong barbi real world realis love anymor wherea ken find motto patriarchi ken return take barbieland persuad ken brainwash rest babi here distraught barbi find gloria america ferrera mattel employe catalyst existenti crisi gloria began play daughter sasha ariana greenblatt barbi toy experienc ident crisi inadvert transfer concern stereotyp barbi gloria restor barbi take mission bring back barbiesit sinc seen goodbudget comedi movi barbi certainli end dri spell i mean one fun ride start end it may littl childishoh that bad wordlet say childfriendli damn funni the humour girlish ye i like from zack snyder the godfath cautionari note margot cast slapstick onelin barbi colour comedi it look like intellig film rather stage crazi comedi that one point id say went wrong climax these charact arent suppos smart intend come end show whi pixar toy stori simpl subtl philosophi toy toy lifetim it may mani owner job stick loyal that human love barbi challeng univers accept theori goe tide now whether good bad i leav choic sinc person opinion isnt affirm theorybarbi meant careerdefin role margot robbi made sure youd rememb forev barbi i kept look singl frame would look pretti i couldnt find minut i melt man ryan gosl ken funniest charact whole movi that cute flirt reluct express jealousi arrog last selfdiscoverythi man live charact kate mckinnon weird barbi appear short time serv enough other babi includ issa rae hari nef alexandra shipp emma mackay dua lipa sharon rooney ana cruz kayn ritu arya nicola coughlan gorgeou on hand kingsley benadir scott evan simu liu rob brydon ncuti gatwa john cena ken add fine support michael cera ariana greenblatt will ferrel pas time well rhea perlman cameo blast the biggest cheer barbi movi came america ferrera monologu describ struggl victori femin ariana greenblatt steal show first rest cast done wellmad budget million barbi lavish big screen entertain product design make sure feel fantasi right those fakish item could exclud kind fun who blame rodrigo prieto camera talk closeup long shot barbi ken barbi loo break courtesi nick houy superb edit music lovabl some peopl often say femal director femal lead pair someth el i accept barbi could lot le underwhelm without greta gerwig thi woman made world ador rummi a flaw script charact sinc discus artist masterpiec cinema let chuck discus let enjoy pinki girli entertain sure take femal audienc storm leav good enough impact men not forget who write itrat
I wanted love with this movie...,"But I didn't. There were many things to like: the cast, the costumes, the Barbieland set and props. There were some funny moments.It's so unfortunate, especially having been a long time Barbie fan and my kids loving Barbie toys/animated movies.This movie is not for kid Barbie lovers. It's just not. I found myself pausing the movie because the kids were lost in the myriad of confusing themes.I have to say the movie was rather disappointing. It started out strong, fun and funny. Then turned into a dark disappointment.Female empowerment and the poke at men/patriarchy was somewhat refreshing. Men have long sexualized women in movies so it was nice to see the reversal.I'm not sure the Director or the script could decide on which message they wanted; so they tried to cram all social issues into one movie.The second half became clunky and weird. The ending was particularly disheartening, instead Barbie taking what she learned, returning to Barbieland and effecting change in her world...she chose stay in the real world.Barbie needed to end more fun, upbeat and positive. Ultimately, the audience is left feeling preached at, judged and wondering what the hell just happened.",i want love movi,but i didnt there mani thing like cast costum barbieland set prop there funni momentsit unfortun especi long time barbi fan kid love barbi toysanim moviesthi movi kid barbi lover it i found paus movi kid lost myriad confus themesi say movi rather disappoint it start strong fun funni then turn dark disappointmentfemal empower poke menpatriarchi somewhat refresh men long sexual woman movi nice see reversalim sure director script could decid messag want tri cram social issu one movieth second half becam clunki weird the end particularli dishearten instead barbi take learn return barbieland effect chang worldsh chose stay real worldbarbi need end fun upbeat posit ultim audienc left feel preach judg wonder hell happen
A darkly satirical look at gender structure in society,"""Barbie"" is a comedy film based on the line of fashion dolls by Mattel. Directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig (""Lady Bird"", ""Little Women"") and starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, it takes every opportunity to revel in its amusing premise with a darkly satirical look at gender structure in society.In Barbieland, a matriarchal utopia where all women are successful, Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives a happy life spending time with her female friends and hanging out with her boyfriend Stereotypical Ken (Ryan Gosling). One night at a dance party, Stereotypical Barbie suddenly finds herself contemplating her own mortality and worries about what her future holds. The next day, Stereotypical Barbie discovers she is now unable to follow her usual routine, which results in her perfect skin breaking out in blemishes. After following advice from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), Stereotypical Barbie travels in her convertible to the real world to meet the child who plays with her, unaware that Stereotypical Ken has stowed away onboard.If you had to name a more iconic doll associated with little girls, I'm sure nearly everyone's first pick would be none other than Mattel's Barbie. Since first being launched back in 1959, Barbie has taken the world by storm, with the doll filling many different roles, including but not limited to a doctor, lawyer, astronaut, and even President of the United States. There have also been many movies made that star Barbie in leading roles, all of which have been CGI animated and released exclusively to video and streaming sites. Now adding to that catalogue, Greta Gerwig's live action cinematic feature titled simply ""Barbie"" is not only a fantastic send-up of gender roles but also a great comedy film in its own right that virtually everyone can enjoy regardless of age, gender, or political leaning.What could have been another generic film for parents to put on in the background to keep their young daughters quiet is actually one of the cleverest deconstructions of the world's view of the societal hierarchy since 2014's ""The LEGO Movie"". When we first see Barbieland, it is shown to be a bustling, exuberant paradise that is perfect for all of its inhabitants. That is, of course, only if you are a woman, and not one of the ""Kens"" where their enjoyment is based solely on being an accessory to the other ""Barbies"". It is obvious that this is a place where men cannot make a name for themselves, which sets in motion Stereotypical Ken's desire to travel with Stereotypical Barbie into the real world. Upon arriving, Ken learns that this new place is the mirror opposite of Barbieland, with real life society valuing patriarchy over matriarchy. In any normal instance, I would have rolled my eyes watching a movie allude to contentious political matters like this, but I quickly realised that the film is actually attacking both sides of the spectrum in the best way possible. In Barbieland, the matriarchy causes the women to exude toxic femininity towards men while in the real world we see the patriarchy make men show off their toxic masculinity towards women. Neither of these are glorified and where this film succeeds greatly is in the way it cleverly informs the audience that the extremes on both ends are what causes problems with society and that too much of either always leads to bad results.In addition to satirising gender norms, the film also functions as an amusing, gag-packed standalone comedy for casual viewers as well. There were a number of moments where I found myself laughing out loud at some of the jokes being made about the autonomous way Barbieland's populace live their lives. For instance, the Barbies are incapable of touching the ground with flat feet due to their default designs being made for high heel shoes. Also, the Kens are almost always seen at the beach awaiting instructions from the other Barbies, only for most of them to be ignored. However, some of the film's most hilarious parts occur when Barbie and Ken are in the real world, allowing for some humorous fish-out-of-water scenes involving their interactions with real people. There's even the occasional jab taken at Mattel themselves, parodying the commercialism surrounding Barbie and all her accessories. While not every single joke lands, there are so many of them that for every one that fails there are plenty of others that work just fine. In fact, without giving it away, this film has one of the funniest closing lines to a movie I've ever heard, so much so that it actually caught me off guard during my initial viewing.I also liked the practical production design of this movie, with minimal CG giving Barbieland a real toy-like aesthetic. As one might expect, the most prominently used colour here is pink. Nearly everything important in this world is pink - pink houses, pink beds, pink lamp posts, etc. Believe it or not, there was actually a worldwide shortage of pink paint due to the amount that was used to make this place look as authentically girly as possible. Later when Barbie and Ken are exploring the outside world, things look decidedly ordinary but since they are still wearing their brightly-coloured outfits, the two to stick out like a sore thumb from everybody else. It's rare for a film to effectively use its colour palette to evoke comedy so effectively and this one handles it in a way that all ages will understand it.As a Barbie girl living in her Barbie world, Margot Robbie is clearly having a great time portraying this stereotypical version of the iconic doll. The fact that there's nothing especially noteworthy about this specific Barbie means that she has the most room to grow as a character. Robbie's Barbie is friendly, fun-loving, but blissfully ignorant of what her boyfriend Ken truly wants with her. Though not outright malicious, she inadvertently makes Ken feel unwanted due to her conditioned attitude towards all the other Kens in her world. What I liked best about Robbie's performance was the way she shows an open-mindedness to the character. She is curious about what type of world lies beyond Barbieland and whether things will be the same or different to what she is used to. It would have been easy to have made this Barbie a man-hating blonde bimbo with no capacity for independent thought but rather she remains pleasant towards everyone and is willing to learn about new experiences on her journey.Whether intentional or not, I think Ryan Gosling's version of Ken steals the movie practically every time he is shown on screen. Maybe it's because I'm so used to seeing Gosling play stoic, subdued roles but watching him come to life as this version of Barbie's boyfriend was quite a surprise. Although this isn't the first comedic role Gosling has played, it is here that he effectively demonstrates all the humorous possibilities he is capable of as an actor. We watch Ken try to surf at the beach as a means to impress Barbie, only to realise he cannot ""swim"" in the placemat water. Later, he tries to apply for certain jobs in the real world based solely on his gender, but is told that he needs proper qualifications in order to be taken seriously by employers. There's just something about the way Gosling is able to showcase such loveable pathos as Ken that makes you want to see how he can become more than just the generic partner of his more famous girlfriend.From the perspective of a 30-something heterosexual man who has never once expressed interest in playing with dolls, the film ""Barbie"" pulls off the miraculous task of transcending above its stereotypical audience of young girls to appeal to all viewers instead. It offers an observant satire about the world's views on gender roles while also functioning as an amusing comedy film packed with jokes galore. No matter what your general opinion on Barbie may be, whether you love her as an entertaining toy or hate her because you don't care for what she represents, this movie has you covered on both fronts. In that regard, this film has done its job.I rate it a solid 9/10.",a darkli satir look gender structur societi,barbi comedi film base line fashion doll mattel direct cowritten greta gerwig ladi bird littl woman star margot robbi ryan gosl take everi opportun revel amus premis darkli satir look gender structur societyin barbieland matriarch utopia woman success stereotyp barbi margot robbi live happi life spend time femal friend hang boyfriend stereotyp ken ryan gosl one night danc parti stereotyp barbi suddenli find contempl mortal worri futur hold the next day stereotyp barbi discov unabl follow usual routin result perfect skin break blemish after follow advic weird barbi kate mckinnon stereotyp barbi travel convert real world meet child play unawar stereotyp ken stow away onboardif name icon doll associ littl girl im sure nearli everyon first pick would none mattel barbi sinc first launch back barbi taken world storm doll fill mani differ role includ limit doctor lawyer astronaut even presid unit state there also mani movi made star barbi lead role cgi anim releas exclus video stream site now ad catalogu greta gerwig live action cinemat featur titl simpli barbi fantast sendup gender role also great comedi film right virtual everyon enjoy regardless age gender polit leaningwhat could anoth gener film parent put background keep young daughter quiet actual one cleverest deconstruct world view societ hierarchi sinc the lego movi when first see barbieland shown bustl exuber paradis perfect inhabit that cours woman one ken enjoy base sole accessori barbi it obviou place men make name set motion stereotyp ken desir travel stereotyp barbi real world upon arriv ken learn new place mirror opposit barbieland real life societi valu patriarchi matriarchi in normal instanc i would roll eye watch movi allud contenti polit matter like i quickli realis film actual attack side spectrum best way possibl in barbieland matriarchi caus woman exud toxic feminin toward men real world see patriarchi make men show toxic masculin toward woman neither glorifi film succe greatli way cleverli inform audienc extrem end caus problem societi much either alway lead bad resultsin addit satiris gender norm film also function amus gagpack standalon comedi casual viewer well there number moment i found laugh loud joke made autonom way barbieland populac live live for instanc barbi incap touch ground flat foot due default design made high heel shoe also ken almost alway seen beach await instruct barbi ignor howev film hilari part occur barbi ken real world allow humor fishoutofwat scene involv interact real peopl there even occasion jab taken mattel parodi commerci surround barbi accessori while everi singl joke land mani everi one fail plenti other work fine in fact without give away film one funniest close line movi ive ever heard much actual caught guard initi viewingi also like practic product design movi minim cg give barbieland real toylik aesthet a one might expect promin use colour pink nearli everyth import world pink pink hous pink bed pink lamp post etc believ actual worldwid shortag pink paint due amount use make place look authent girli possibl later barbi ken explor outsid world thing look decidedli ordinari sinc still wear brightlycolour outfit two stick like sore thumb everybodi el it rare film effect use colour palett evok comedi effect one handl way age understand ita barbi girl live barbi world margot robbi clearli great time portray stereotyp version icon doll the fact there noth especi noteworthi specif barbi mean room grow charact robbi barbi friendli funlov bliss ignor boyfriend ken truli want though outright malici inadvert make ken feel unwant due condit attitud toward ken world what i like best robbi perform way show openminded charact she curiou type world lie beyond barbieland whether thing differ use it would easi made barbi manhat blond bimbo capac independ thought rather remain pleasant toward everyon will learn new experi journeywheth intent i think ryan gosl version ken steal movi practic everi time shown screen mayb im use see gosl play stoic subdu role watch come life version barbi boyfriend quit surpris although isnt first comed role gosl play effect demonstr humor possibl capabl actor we watch ken tri surf beach mean impress barbi realis swim placemat water later tri appli certain job real world base sole gender told need proper qualif order taken serious employ there someth way gosl abl showcas loveabl patho ken make want see becom gener partner famou girlfriendfrom perspect someth heterosexu man never express interest play doll film barbi pull miracul task transcend stereotyp audienc young girl appeal viewer instead it offer observ satir world view gender role also function amus comedi film pack joke galor no matter gener opinion barbi may whether love entertain toy hate dont care repres movi cover front in regard film done jobi rate solid

Good to see different versions of Barbie over several generations.Story was not very strong, but this is more a visual show than anything.

Funny but toxic feminist tale that doesn't make sense,"The movie has a very clever intro, a charming set-up filled with sight gags, and some hilarious lines (especially those spoken by the narrator - Helen Mirren).However, it's essentially about a town of marginalized and emasculated men (the Kens) and when they discover they are only disaffected props, they create a toxic patriarchy (although we never see how they do it). The Barbies then manipulate the Kens, using feminine wiles and playing dumb, to coerce the Kens into a war with each other to distract them back into submission.Adding to a magnum of plot holes, and an ending that takes WAY too long, is a weird 'Pinocchio' twist when Barbie only becomes satisfied with her existence when she gets a vagina.This film panders to a pseudo-feminist audience. If you want to see a film where feminism is funny and wins in the end, see Legally Blonde.",funni toxic feminist tale doesnt make sen,the movi clever intro charm setup fill sight gag hilari line especi spoken narrat helen mirrenhowev essenti town margin emascul men ken discov disaffect prop creat toxic patriarchi although never see the barbi manipul ken use feminin wile play dumb coerc ken war distract back submissionad magnum plot hole end take way long weird pinocchio twist barbi becom satisfi exist get vaginathi film pander pseudofeminist audienc if want see film femin funni win end see legal blond
A colorful love letter to human kind,"I cried, I laughed, I dance and I did sing too. What a joyful time I had at the movies watching Barbie. This is a movie to celebrate how diverse and complicated are the humans. The cinematography is a outstanding as well as the production design and the vestuary. The casting seems like made in heaven. I recommend this movie for 11+ years old. And if you have a teen at home, take her with you. Barbie goes from fun to introspection and I love a good comedy that makes you think. Ryan Gosling is the perfect Ken, he does everything in this movie and shines every time he shows up. Margo is a perfect Barbie and got a real sense of the relevance this is going to have.",a color love letter human kind,i cri i laugh i danc i sing what joy time i movi watch barbi thi movi celebr diver complic human the cinematographi outstand well product design vestuari the cast seem like made heaven i recommend movi year old and teen home take barbi goe fun introspect i love good comedi make think ryan gosl perfect ken everyth movi shine everi time show margo perfect barbi got real sen relev go
I didn't laugh once,"I had trouble following this story. I got the general idea but the dialog seemed to be all over the place. In a nutshell the story is as follows. Barbie senses someone is feeling bad in the real world then leaves Barbieland to try to make the person feel better about themselves. Meanwhile Ken discovers that men have more power in the real world than in Barbieland so when he goes back he rallies the other Ken dolls to take power by force. Meanwhile the Barbie's decide to stand up for themselves and take Barbieland back. Somehow there's some middle ground resolution which didn't seem to make sense. The end. I didn't laugh once so I'm not sure where the comedy aspects were. I was also disappointed when Ken and Barbie broke out into song in the final act. It seems that whenever Hollywood has a bad story then they turn it into a musical. This film was as shallow and one dimensional as a plastic doll who can't bend their knees. The characters were so boring. Nothing much happens and then I was just left waiting for the film to finish. I don't expect this film to win many awards. It was more of an idea than a film with substance. I suppose it's one saving grace was that it's very much in line with American consumerism and patriotic to the 1980's American ideals of beach culture and beauty. The film manages to capitalise and celebrate the bright 1980's fluorescent colour palette that was shovelled at teenage girls in the era, ala slap bands, rollerblades, Alf and fruity loops cereal. However, Barbie as a character seems to be stuck in the 1980's and is really outdated and boring in the 2020's. Some things should be left to age gracefully into history. Especially, a stiff plastic doll without much personality.",i didnt laugh,i troubl follow stori i got gener idea dialog seem place in nutshel stori follow barbi sen someon feel bad real world leav barbieland tri make person feel better meanwhil ken discov men power real world barbieland goe back ralli ken doll take power forc meanwhil barbi decid stand take barbieland back somehow there middl ground resolut didnt seem make sen the end i didnt laugh im sure comedi aspect i also disappoint ken barbi broke song final act it seem whenev hollywood bad stori turn music thi film shallow one dimension plastic doll cant bend knee the charact bore noth much happen i left wait film finish i dont expect film win mani award it idea film substanc i suppos one save grace much line american consumer patriot american ideal beach cultur beauti the film manag capitalis celebr bright fluoresc colour palett shovel teenag girl era ala slap band rollerblad alf fruiti loop cereal howev barbi charact seem stuck realli outdat bore some thing left age grace histori especi stiff plastic doll without much person
"Heart-warming, serious and such an important movie for everyone to see!","When I sat down to watch this film I assumed it would be some fun pink silly movie but it was not in the best possible way. It starts very much in that way but the second Barbie gets to the real world everything changes and the film makes so many important statements on sexism and the treatment of women. I thought it perfectly addressed the affect Barbie has had on the world and never shied away from it. This movie does not flinch away from the reality of the world or what damage ignorance can do (Ken). America Ferrera's speech is amazing and moved me so much as did Barbie's own found freedom.

"Clever, dazzling, but somewhat incoherent","On the plus side, this was an ambitious, dazzling film with what I felt was an original concept. It explored the world of gender stereotyping and male-female relationships, using the world of Barbie and Ken as its base point. There was a strong feminist theme running through it, but I did not find this overwhelming. Whilst the male figures were often portrayed as stupid and one-dimensional, this was done with some wit and indeed affection.The action migrated between the real world and the mythical world of Barbie, and so perhaps it was no surprise that the plot tended to meander and remained unconvincing. The energy of the film was sustained by the comedy and the zaniness of the characters.I differ from some critics in that I thought the best performance came from Margot Robbie as Barbie. Her character bounced between parody and realism but she managed the demands well. I thought that the much acclaimed Ryan Gosling tended to over-act and his character became annoying.This may be down to my age and my Englishness, but I was unable to make out the detail of the many snappy one-liners that were delivered. The young and the American will probably not have this trouble.Though likeable and even moving in places, altogether this film felt like less than the sum of its parts. Its attempts at juggling comedy and serious themes, fantasy and reality, were not ultimately successful and it became incoherent and lacking in some kind of unity.Ultimately, for me, the acid test of a film is the issue of whether or when I start wanting it to end. I made it to about two-thirds of the way through.",clever dazzl somewhat incoher,on plu side ambiti dazzl film i felt origin concept it explor world gender stereotyp malefemal relationship use world barbi ken base point there strong feminist theme run i find overwhelm whilst male figur often portray stupid onedimension done wit inde affectionth action migrat real world mythic world barbi perhap surpris plot tend meander remain unconvinc the energi film sustain comedi zani charactersi differ critic i thought best perform came margot robbi barbi her charact bounc parodi realism manag demand well i thought much acclaim ryan gosl tend overact charact becam annoyingthi may age english i unabl make detail mani snappi onelin deliv the young american probabl troublethough likeabl even move place altogeth film felt like le sum part it attempt juggl comedi seriou theme fantasi realiti ultim success becam incoher lack kind unityultim acid test film issu whether i start want end i made twothird way
A haphazardly thrown together storyline without any real plot,"1 point lost for the storyline, it lacked a clear/meaningful plot that the viewer can use to surmise the movie at the end.1 point lost for the sub-storylines, which were used to haphazardly throw together the main storyline. But none of these sub-storylines truly resolved or offered the viewer any closure.1 point lost for the poorly made costumes - the Barbie cowgirl pants werd ill-fitting and made of cheap material. It's Barbie - you don't skint in fashion.1 point lost for the casting of non-value add supporting characters which just contributed to more confusion on an ill-defined plot.1 point lost for the absence of key characters from the Barbieworld, these include Kelly and her multitude of pets.1 point lost for the ending which was unrelated to anything that happened in the film and just further ingrained the fact that the movie lacked any real story telling.Positives are that Margot Robbie was perfectly cast for the lead role, as well as Ryan Gosling as Ken (though another point lost here because I felt like his character wasn't utilised effectively).The real life facts throughout the film also served as nice little of trivia nuggets.",a haphazardli thrown togeth storylin without real plot,point lost storylin lack clearmeaning plot viewer use surmis movi end point lost substorylin use haphazardli throw togeth main storylin but none substorylin truli resolv offer viewer closur point lost poorli made costum barbi cowgirl pant werd illfit made cheap materi it barbi dont skint fashion point lost cast nonvalu add support charact contribut confus illdefin plot point lost absenc key charact barbieworld includ kelli multitud pet point lost end unrel anyth happen film ingrain fact movi lack real stori tellingposit margot robbi perfectli cast lead role well ryan gosl ken though anoth point lost i felt like charact wasnt utilis effectivelyth real life fact throughout film also serv nice littl trivia nugget
Just good fun and a great soundtrack,"Even though I never played with Barbie myself, when word came out of a Barbie movie being released, I knew I had to watch it!.With Barbie being a worldwide icon, a cast like this movie and a soundtrack like that, I still had my doubts this was going to be any good. I went to the cinema with an open mind and in the back of my head with the idea that I knew this might not be it for me.Overall the movie is packed with some great humor and a beautiful underlying story about who Barbie really is. If you look at the cast you'll see that all the women that portray Barbie are also called Barbie, but this movie, as well as the dolls in real life show that a Barbie can be anything. Even though our main Barbie played by the magnificent Margot Robbie was the ''stereotypical Barbie'' and I did like some of the more versatile characters, I still think they could have done better than having one bigger Barbie and one in a wheelchair.I admit that 9 is a high rating but after leaving the movie theatre 24 hours later and stil stuck with the lyrics of Ryan Gosling singing ''I'm just Ken'', I can't help but to give a solid 9.Although this movie in any other context might be ''forgettable'', it is still a Barbie movie and it was just good fun. The humor was good, the cast was great and the soundtrack might be one of the strongest things about the movie. The outfits, especially worn by Margot Robbie were stunning.This movie is not going to be for everyone. It was very fake, theatrical and very ''Barbie (of course). I still loved every part of it even though I never played with Barbie or even seen any Barbie movie before this.",just good fun great soundtrack,even though i never play barbi word came barbi movi releas i knew i watch itwith barbi worldwid icon cast like movi soundtrack like i still doubt go good i went cinema open mind back head idea i knew might meoveral movi pack great humor beauti underli stori barbi realli if look cast youll see woman portray barbi also call barbi movi well doll real life show barbi anyth even though main barbi play magnific margot robbi stereotyp barbi i like versatil charact i still think could done better one bigger barbi one wheelchairi admit high rate leav movi theatr hour later stil stuck lyric ryan gosl sing im ken i cant help give solid although movi context might forgett still barbi movi good fun the humor good cast great soundtrack might one strongest thing movi the outfit especi worn margot robbi stunningthi movi go everyon it fake theatric barbi cours i still love everi part even though i never play barbi even seen barbi movi
Doesn't hold up to the hype,"Barbie is a good movie. The visuals are nice to look at, the premise is quirky, the dialogues are often witty, it's somewhat self-aware, and even (some of) the songs are pretty great. It made me laugh, it made me smile, and that's great.And yet... it's definitely not a great movie. From what I'd gathered, it's supposed to be a pointed satire that will quickly become a corner stone of gender equality. Instead, it's overly preachy, reductionist, occasionally fails to see the point, and only repeats a message that countless other movies have raised before in much more elaborate manners.The largest problem, though, is the lack of a clear target audience. There are many series and movies that are primarily focused towards children but that can be appreciated by adults as well. Barbie certainly doesn't fit in this regime; I heavily doubt that many children will care about this heavy-handed discussion of an essential adult topic. And yet it is also a bit too silly to properly work as a movie that's targeted at adults.If the movie had come out two decades ago, it would've been brave, and we would be more easily able to forgive it its many flaws. But this is 2023, where women's rights are actively backsliding in large parts of the world, and where the primary issue of gender equality is no longer man vs woman but binary vs pluralistic.Nevertheless, Barbie is a fun movie. Parts of it are fantastic. It's much better than anything we could've expected from a Barbie movie. It just isn't the ultimate social critic it was portrayed as.",doesnt hold hype,barbi good movi the visual nice look premis quirki dialogu often witti somewhat selfawar even song pretti great it made laugh made smile that greatand yet definit great movi from id gather suppos point satir quickli becom corner stone gender equal instead overli preachi reductionist occasion fail see point repeat messag countless movi rais much elabor mannersth largest problem though lack clear target audienc there mani seri movi primarili focus toward child appreci adult well barbi certainli doesnt fit regim i heavili doubt mani child care heavyhand discus essenti adult topic and yet also bit silli properli work movi that target adultsif movi come two decad ago wouldv brave would easili abl forgiv mani flaw but woman right activ backslid larg part world primari issu gender equal longer man v woman binari v pluralisticnevertheless barbi fun movi part fantast it much better anyth couldv expect barbi movi it isnt ultim social critic portray
Unfocused jumbled mess,I thought this was going to be a movie about the Barbie doll. I thought it would be somewhat entertaining and funny. The beginning was actually brilliant with its ode to a previous classic film i will not name so as not to spoil it. And then everything fell apart. The movie gets lost in its own attempted message of feminism and gender equality. It doesn't make its point at all and becomes incoherent and scrambled. There was no message as the movie tries to make a statement but comes across heavy-handed and confused. I looked at my watch several times to see how much more of this poorly directed mumbo-jumbo I had to tolerate. Best Picture nominee? No way.,unfocus jumbl mess,i thought go movi barbi doll i thought would somewhat entertain funni the begin actual brilliant ode previou classic film name spoil and everyth fell apart the movi get lost attempt messag femin gender equal it doesnt make point becom incoher scrambl there messag movi tri make statement come across heavyhand confus i look watch sever time see much poorli direct mumbojumbo i toler best pictur nomine no way

"Pink Political Power is: Fun, Funny At Times, Deep, But Aggressively Weird","LIKES:The Setting:
-It feels like a Barbie world in real life and captures the energy of the doll in all glory.-Plenty of accessories, the plastic feeling, and the toy like atmosphere with real life people is totally captured and super fun.-The real world is fine and does the job of acting as the second world, but it's really Barbie land that excels in the feeling of Mattel bringing it to life.The Plot's Originality:
-Yes, much of it is predictable and familiar, but there is more to it than meets the eye
-Barbie's plot is one part comedy, one part discovery, and one part political philosophy that sort of gives you a variety I wasn't expecting.-It may feel a little out there, but points for trying to be different and more advanced than many other stories have attempted.The Acting:
-McKinnon may have been used too much, but I loved her in this film for the way her weirdness works for weird Barbie. Quirky, fun, a little bold, but that SNL line delivery that really works for delivering lines.-Rae is fine for when she is on screen. She's got a few dynamics that her monotone delivery works with what you got, but to get top bill/first bill doesn't make sense to me
-Ryan Gosling works well int eh roles, and for his direction, a supporting actor role nomination feels good for me. He's clumsy, funny, hardcore silly, and it works for the ridiculous nature and tone of the movie.-And for Margot Robbie, the woman continues to knock the ball out of the park for how amazing she fits the role. She's sparkly, quirky, but has a range that she just brings. Gerwig brought some new elements out in terms of representation thought maybe not the Oscar performance like some call for.The Comedy At Times:
-The movie does have general jokes that worked very well for me, well timed moments that were perfect for breaking the moment.-Satire, to a point, was amazing at times at how much fun they had with certain concepts. The design of Barbie dolls that failed, or the fact of fashion drawing eyes, and even certain trends that we love. It was clever, balanced, and had this timing delivery that worked.-Some of the Ken lines were funny, the fact that I was like classic Patrick from SpongeBob was very fun, especially when sometimes paired with one of the other style of jokes.-And Helen Mirren's narration was the funniest component for me. Her dry delivery, the classy sass, and the fact the woman just sells the lines was my favorite part in terms of laughs and wished there had been more.-As such, the comedy did work at times for me.The Pace:
-It's two hours long, but for the most part doesn't feel it and that goes to the fun pacing.-Barbie starts out fun, exciting, and pops into the adventure with a lot of energy.-Then that energy sort of stays, but hunkers down a bit, never losing the whimsy, but finding a means to feel entertaining and somewhat engaging.-That is the superior quality of this movie compared to the other big one, that engaging pace and just having fun.The Music:
-By far, the music is what works the best for me in this movie and tells so much and brings so much energy in the track list.-The songs from the radio and the past work well, comedic devices that were quite honestly some of the best jokes for me with several of the characters.-Other songs are fun musical numbers that work, dance numbers full of pop vibe, or later a true stage show musical that had the theatrics and jazz of a stage show.-As for the new songs that were made for the movie, they were my favorite. Remixes of Barbie girl, an exposition song and reprise, and a few other numbers just have so much character that it really added points for me in terms of just how much fun Barbie can be.The Message:
-There is a very deep message to this movie, and to be honest... I did enjoy this part of Gerwig's writing.-It's deep, has character development and really drives home a lot of social commentary and trends under the microscope about human qualities. I liked how it was built in, and the dialog to embrace it, and just wished this movie had kept that in line with me.DISLIKES:The Fun Vibes Take a Detour:
-I just said the pace was good and there was an energy, but... the fun part did take a detour the further you went into the film.-Gerwig is a very ""unique"" writer and once she got her hooks into her political writing, there were times where the first part of the film's fun was lost to very agenda heavy writing.-I t felt a bit forced for me, and I longed for more numbers, a little adventure, and a little less banter/beating the dead horse that the film went.-Throw in the darker aspects of the agenda, and losing that fun at the beginning was not what I would have liked to see for most of the movie.Gerwig's Hyper Agenda
-I get this is who she is, but I've seen movies where that side of her is toned down and we get a much deeper character drama.-But Barbie... Barbie pulls no punches and berates you with very in your face, no holds bar, rather excessive and in some cases insulting humor that I got tired of.-There were times where that line was perfect and the story quality maximized, but most of the movie failed that balance and she did not seem sorry for what I felt was a tad too toxic for my liking.-If you are a fan of this type of hyper writing, then you are in great shape, but for those like me who are tired of movies becoming agenda venting, this movie is going to lose points for being annoying and simplistic and losing the creative spark.The Stupidity:
-The movie has a smart writer and so seeing so much ridiculous silliness in one movie to contradict the smart writing didn't accomplish much for me.-Will Ferrell's direction was one of these moments where he was a straight up idiot, saying weird things that were more awkward and uncomfortable than funny for me. His little montage was just really dumb and to the point it stuck out a bit too much.-Meanwhile, Ken's handling was fine being a moron, but Gerwig's political writing sort of didn't do much for me as rather than improving and becoming elevated like his counterpart, sort of grew toxic level stupid.-That excessiveness again just doesn't work when I saw those sparkling moments that show where everything comes together, instead of feeling like an adult version of a Disney Channel Original movie.The Character Usage is odd:
-The movie is trying to balance a lot of names and characters and it only works on that half of the time.-Barbie has too many characters, and some of the people I expected to have more time, were limited than I anticipated and quite honestly a political tool.-They do their work, but, it's just missing balance and full use and I think it's relying too much on a sequel and people just happy with being comedic props and line spewers than anything else.The Story Is All Over The Place:
-My fellow reviewers are right, it's a weird story and it is all over the place.-This might give it the unique twist, but Barbie's tale is a jumble of lots of different feels and theatrics that sort of work together, but feel messily put together.-One level is like I said fun, bright, and feels like a dance party meets on stage musical that works to an extent.-The second then becomes this dive into the psyche mixed with somehow comedically stupid gimmicks to try and keep entertaining going
-Third then goes metaphysical and really deep, and it kind of works, but then goes really odd and sort of trippy, to a way I'm still trying to process.-Gerwig's writing is always deeper and more complex, but this might have tried to be a bit too ambitious for its own good for me and felt just so scrambled and very much in your face for plot telling.The VERDICT:
Barbie is a venue that I really did have some fun with and was surprised by the unexpected things it had to offer and the clever writing I had hoped would shine in. A geek like me knowing the references, appreciating the pokes to it, and the fun timing of some well-written lines that had me laughing in the theater. I loved the acting, loved the set, and just loved a lot of the vibes of the less agenda writing really worked for me and will appeal to many of the general group. And the music, whew, really loved it and the energy and storytelling it did which was very good for me. But the movie did not appeal to me in that Gerwig seemed to reach too high for being unique and ""elevated"" leading to moments that just don't appeal to a reviewer like me. The detour of fun for very politically heavy writing was probably my least favorite aspect, losing the killer vibes and balanced fun and humor with a very polarized way of thinking was not my cup of tea. In addition the story elements and character usage felt a bit jumbled, scrambled, shallow, and having too many character moments to really show off Gerwig's better writing. Thus, when balancing this out, my score for this movie is that it's a theater worthy film for a lot of groups and dates. The score is:Adventure/Comedy/Fantasy: 7.5-8.0

Wildly misunderstood by the poor reviewers.,"Unfortunately, most reviews that I've read here that score this film poorly explain so clearly that the reviewer did not understand the message of the film. It is not anti-men, it does not portray men as ""stupid"". Take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century - oh yes, just as Ken is here! The movie exaggerates this, yes. That is the point. To clearly (and humourously) highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed. Stop being offended by something that isn't offensive and take a bit of time to actually think about the film that you have watched.The film was fun, emotional, moving, sad and empowering in many ways. I must admit I hadn't expected to enjoy this film, but wow, what a surprise!",wildli misunderstood poor review,unfortun review ive read score film poorli explain clearli review understand messag film it antimen portray men stupid take moment think woman portray movi last centuri oh ye ken the movi exagger ye that point to clearli humour highlight inequ role revers stop offend someth isnt offens take bit time actual think film watchedth film fun emot move sad empow mani way i must admit i hadnt expect enjoy film wow surpris
"Barbie-Verse begins,","As I watched Barbie the Movie, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me. The vibrant pink color that permeated the film brought back memories of my childhood, when everything seemed so vibrant and full of life.What struck me most about the movie was that it wasn't a typical superhero genre movie, which is so common in today's movie industry. Instead, it was a live-action non-comic book movie that was a breath of fresh air.The movie sets were stunning, with wild and imaginative backgrounds that were so fun to see on a beach. The foreground was equally as enjoyable, with standees that added a touch of whimsy to the film.As I watched the movie, I couldn't help but feel like a kid again. The childhood thoughts and memories that flooded my mind made me feel like I was back in time, experiencing the joy and wonder of childhood all over again.Overall, Barbie the Movie was a pleasure to watch.

It was pretty good but not worthy of the hype,"Barbie was an entertaining movie, but was definitely not worth the hype that accompanied the film. The messages the movie wanted to share were so on the nose and explicit that it became jarring and weird. The movie also meandered from place to place and didn't seem to have a purpose for the majority of its run time.Ryan Gosling was hilarious though and stole every scene he was in. Several of the cameos were also great.Had fun, but wouldn't really recommend it as a 'must watch'. Mostly watched it as the first part of the Barbenheimer meme, so it was worth it for that reason at least.7/10.",it pretti good worthi hype,barbi entertain movi definit worth hype accompani film the messag movi want share nose explicit becam jar weird the movi also meander place place didnt seem purpos major run timeryan gosl hilari though stole everi scene sever cameo also greathad fun wouldnt realli recommend must watch mostli watch first part barbenheim meme worth reason least
It's really something different and that's a good thing,"It's really something different but some of it feels inspired by other films, I caught references to Fight Club, 2001 Space Odyssey, Lego Movie, and others I can't think of at the moment. But yeah, this was a special film. I don't think as many people will like it as it probably deserves. But I did love most of it. Sometimes the tones felt off at times but it's definitely recommended to see. The satire works great here and the production design, cinematography and acting (intentionally bad in a way on purpose in some spots to deliver the satire aspects) are all perfectly done here though overall. The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well. Definitely recommend anyone to give it a chance. I wouldn't say this is a family movie but I think families with older kids would work perfectly for this. Not sure this will be in the Oscar race but it seems like it will at least for technical aspects and production designs.",it realli someth differ that good thing,it realli someth differ feel inspir film i caught refer fight club space odyssey lego movi other i cant think moment but yeah special film i dont think mani peopl like probabl deserv but i love sometim tone felt time definit recommend see the satir work great product design cinematographi act intent bad way purpos spot deliv satir aspect perfectli done though overal the music highlight sometim hilari remind lego movi way ryan gosl margot robbi pitch perfect well definit recommend anyon give chanc i wouldnt say famili movi i think famili older kid would work perfectli not sure oscar race seem like least technic aspect product design
Starts well.. but then..,"Barbie made a strong start really. Loved the characters, loved the production design and love love the acting of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling but then along the way something happened and the characters dev becomes confusing.Certain characters portraying Mattel exec were added in but in the end they don't really represent anything because their characters doesn't evolve.. and for me it feels to forced to put Mattel in there as a character because of course the would like to look like they are neutral or even a solution, to which we thought, was a problem. However since in the end they practically does not do anything then you are left with the question, do we really need to see the Mattel executives in here?It certainly feel like the script has been rewritten a few times thus the message becomes quite complicated, convoluted and confusing for general folks like me. Is it really satire or is it not? Why are the kens treated like secondclass citizens at the end and why the barbies.",start well,barbi made strong start realli love charact love product design love love act margot robbi ryan gosl along way someth happen charact dev becom confusingcertain charact portray mattel exec ad end dont realli repres anyth charact doesnt evolv feel forc put mattel charact cours would like look like neutral even solut thought problem howev sinc end practic anyth left question realli need see mattel execut hereit certainli feel like script rewritten time thu messag becom quit complic convolut confus gener folk like is realli satir whi ken treat like secondclass citizen end barbi
Meh. Not really all that funny,"The fact that this movie did so well proves how bad this summer is for movies. I don't see what the big deal is, it felt like a mixed bag of boredom with some entertainment. There's a few laughs, few and far between that is.If you're interested in seeing this film I can't recommend paying your hard earned money that's required to see it in the theatres. Not to mention if you want popcorn and snacks. I recommend Wait until it's on a streaming service you already have or at your local library where you can get it for free.

MEANINGFUL MOVIE.,"Very well made. Terrific directing, acting and writing. It gets deeper at times, but the best part of it is that it isn't trying to be heavy and ""meaningful"" the whole way through. It has a good balance of the more emotional moments with lighthearted humor.Synopsis:

Barbie suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence.Leaping out of her pink plastic wonderland onto the big screen, the most famous doll in the world is ready to break free in Greta Gerwig's epic live-action adventure, starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling.

A very enjoyable film,"Barbie is the latest toy being turned into a live action movie and stars Margot Robbie(Suicide Squad), Ryan Gosling(La La Land),Michael Cena(Scott Pilgram Vs The World),Alexandra Shipp(A Dogs Way Home),America Ferrara (Ugly Betty)and Will Ferrell(Elf). Directed by Greta Gerwig the film follows Barbie(Robbie) a sophisticated young doll who notices that she is slowly turning human so she goes to the real world to find her previous owner and to meet the CEO boss (Ferrell) to find out why she is malfunctioning.Will she go back to BarbieLand or stay in the real world. Overall I was very surprised by this film. The cinematography was very good if not artificial,the story reminded me of Elf meets The Lego Movie. Ryan Gosling was hysterical as Ken. Also stars Rhea Pherlman from Matilda,Helen Mirren as the narrator who throws fourth wall jokes,singer Dua Lipa as a mermaid and John Cena as a merman.

Meh...,"Well, I have to admit that all the hype around this movie eventually made me sit down to watch it together with my wife and son. And my son quickly lost interest in the movie and left, and I have to admit that my interest in the movie was waning and dissipating about the halfway marker.Yeah, this movie is seriously over-hyped and it is amped up to be all that and then some, when, in fact, it wasn't all that and a bag of potato chips. I found the storyline in the movie to be rather bland and pointless, and thus found very little entertainment in the movie. And that made sitting through 114 minutes of it quite the ordeal. Yet, I managed to endure, because I wanted to see if there was anything to the hype. So writers Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach didn't exactly impress me with this movie.There wasn't!Sure, the movie had a good cast ensemble, and there were some fair performances. But it was just difficult to abhor from the lack of an interesting storyline and script to enjoy the acting performances.Visually then director Greta Gerwig certainly managed to make it look and feel like it took place in Barbieland, with all the vibrant colors, toy-like appearances of things. So that definitely helped to make things a bit more bearable to sit through.""Barbie"" is not a childrens movie, which you would otherwise assume from a movie based on Mattel's popular doll line.Right, well I can check ""Barbie"" off of the watched-movie list now, and I can honestly say that I am never returning to watch it a second time. And if this movie spawns a sequel, I doubt it very much that I will actually sit down to watching it.My rating of ""Barbie"" from director Greta Gerwig's 2023 movie ""Barbie"" lands on a four out of ten stars.",meh,well i admit hype around movi eventu made sit watch togeth wife son and son quickli lost interest movi left i admit interest movi wane dissip halfway markeryeah movi serious overhyp amp fact wasnt bag potato chip i found storylin movi rather bland pointless thu found littl entertain movi and made sit minut quit ordeal yet i manag endur i want see anyth hype so writer greta gerwig noah baumbach didnt exactli impress moviether wasntsur movi good cast ensembl fair perform but difficult abhor lack interest storylin script enjoy act performancesvisu director greta gerwig certainli manag make look feel like took place barbieland vibrant color toylik appear thing so definit help make thing bit bearabl sit throughbarbi child movi would otherwis assum movi base mattel popular doll lineright well i check barbi watchedmovi list i honestli say i never return watch second time and movi spawn sequel i doubt much i actual sit watch itmi rate barbi director greta gerwig movi barbi land four ten star
Greta shows real power of woman in Barbie,"Greta Gerwig's Barbie explores creation myths in Barbieland, a parallel universe populated by Mattel dolls. The director uses the toy conglomerate's vast archive and successful products as tools to create a rich and weird material. The movie is a clever send-up of Barbie dolls and their legacy, featuring light-hearted jokes that poke fun at Mattel, the doll's lore, and the contradictions of our sexist society. The director's storytelling is impressive, and the film's humor is both lighthearted and chuckle-worthy. Gerwig's Barbieland, created by Sarah Greenwood and Jacqueline Durran, is a pink fever dream with funky compositions by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, bubblegum anthems by Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, and Ice Spice. The film features plastic trees and identical two-story Barbie dream homes, with flying being the preferred mode of transportation. The production design and costuming are exceptional, showcasing Gerwig's passion for details and her ability to create a dreamlike world. Barbieland is a feminist utopia in which Barbies serve as presidents, Supreme Court members, doctors, physicists, Nobel prize winners, and cancer cures. The dolls are not structurally different from our world, but they are represented by political fantasy and decade-dependent what-ifs. Barbie has gone to space, could vote, and own property before many human women, and her appearance has changed to mirror society's beauty politics. The representational doll has become an extension of political fantasy, reflecting the beauty politics of society. Gerwig features a cast of Barbies, including Issa Rae, Emma Mackey, Alexandra Shipp, and Hari Nef. Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) is the protagonist, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed Barbie created by Ruth Handler. Her Ken counterpart, Ryan Gosling, is portrayed with humor and heart. They are a version of Eve and Adam, with their fall being dramatic. Barbie finds her perfect life hampered by existential thoughts and seeks answers from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a doll with a traumatic history. Stereotypical Barbie, with Ken, heads to real-world Los Angeles to find her little girl. The relationship between Barbies and their human owners is tenuously outlined, so it's best not to think too deeply about how it all works. Robbie's performance in Gerwig's Barbie highlights the tension between Barbie as an object and subject. Her expressive eyes and physical presence reveal the human world's forces, while her rigid presence in Barbieland suggests she's not less rigid in the real world. Despite the director's skill in capturing deeper themes, the film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest it ultimately serves a brand. The film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest the film serves as a brand. Gerwig's film Barbieland is a mix of fun and emotional depth, with a tension between keeping Barbie entertaining and blending her source material with previous projects. After a detour, Barbie returns home to find Ken's patriarchal knowledge has transformed Barbieland. The screenplay, by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, avoids familiarity and mockery, but the moments that aren't just funny are buried in important monologues, making the gestures feel politically hollow. The film's mandate is too ambitious, making it feel politically hollow.",greta show real power woman barbi,greta gerwig barbi explor creation myth barbieland parallel univers popul mattel doll the director use toy conglomer vast archiv success product tool creat rich weird materi the movi clever sendup barbi doll legaci featur lightheart joke poke fun mattel doll lore contradict sexist societi the director storytel impress film humor lightheart chuckleworthi gerwig barbieland creat sarah greenwood jacquelin durran pink fever dream funki composit mark ronson andrew wyatt bubblegum anthem dua lipa nicki minaj ice spice the film featur plastic tree ident twostori barbi dream home fli prefer mode transport the product design costum except showcas gerwig passion detail abil creat dreamlik world barbieland feminist utopia barbi serv presid suprem court member doctor physicist nobel prize winner cancer cure the doll structur differ world repres polit fantasi decadedepend whatif barbi gone space could vote properti mani human woman appear chang mirror societi beauti polit the represent doll becom extens polit fantasi reflect beauti polit societi gerwig featur cast barbi includ issa rae emma mackey alexandra shipp hari nef stereotyp barbi margot robbi protagonist blondehair blueey barbi creat ruth handler her ken counterpart ryan gosl portray humor heart they version eve adam fall dramat barbi find perfect life hamper existenti thought seek answer weird barbi kate mckinnon doll traumat histori stereotyp barbi ken head realworld lo angel find littl girl the relationship barbi human owner tenuous outlin best think deepli work robbi perform gerwig barbi highlight tension barbi object subject her express eye physic presenc reveal human world forc rigid presenc barbieland suggest she le rigid real world despit director skill captur deeper theme film omin muddi polit suggest ultim serv brand the film omin muddi polit suggest film serv brand gerwig film barbieland mix fun emot depth tension keep barbi entertain blend sourc materi previou project after detour barbi return home find ken patriarch knowledg transform barbieland the screenplay gerwig noah baumbach avoid familiar mockeri moment arent funni buri import monologu make gestur feel polit hollow the film mandat ambiti make feel polit hollow
Not Kenough,"Barbie is a thoughtful homage to an iconic toy brand that overturns the well known stereotype of the blonde, plastic ""bimbo"". It is also undeniably Mattel's punt at keeping Barbie relevant and commercially viable for the next generation.In one fell swoop a corporate, patriarchal brand tries to distance its own corporate image from Barbie ""herself"" whilst also politically sanitising their toy brand at the same time. It's a PR stunt through and through. They want Barbie to be about individuality and self-determination, and that's all well and good; but there's still a corporate brand behind the curtain, even despite the gags (Will Ferrell) alluding to that ironic hypocrisy, such as the groveling admission about ""one or two"" previous Mattel CEOs being women, amongst a long line of men.That aside, on its own merits as a film this was very preachy and very convoluted throughout, the crossover between the two ""worlds"" was a really cool idea that just needed more development and streamlining to land properly. Barbie was well cast (Margot Robbie), as was her playboy, Ken (Ryan Gosling) and the comic relief alter-Ken, Alan (Michael Cera). Many of the ingredients and characters for a good film were present, but the execution fell flat.Somewhere beneath the political hullabaloo the film contains a valid message about mutual respect between the genders and a lesson on self actualisation. But ultimately, the film forgot that Barbie and Ken could have had some *fun* whilst also making the points the film set out to make. Making many of the characters superficial Kens or Barbies made the palette a boring and grating one, even despite the points that were trying to be made about individuality. The film also often lacked the light touch needed to captivate young girls who actually play with Barbie dolls and who won't necessarily understand the high level commentary at play here. Even if a mum or elder sister explains it to them afterwards.",not kenough,barbi thought homag icon toy brand overturn well known stereotyp blond plastic bimbo it also undeni mattel punt keep barbi relev commerci viabl next generationin one fell swoop corpor patriarch brand tri distanc corpor imag barbi whilst also polit sanitis toy brand time it pr stunt they want barbi individu selfdetermin that well good there still corpor brand behind curtain even despit gag will ferrel allud iron hypocrisi grovel admiss one two previou mattel ceo woman amongst long line menthat asid merit film preachi convolut throughout crossov two world realli cool idea need develop streamlin land properli barbi well cast margot robbi playboy ken ryan gosl comic relief alterken alan michael cera mani ingredi charact good film present execut fell flatsomewher beneath polit hullabaloo film contain valid messag mutual respect gender lesson self actualis but ultim film forgot barbi ken could fun whilst also make point film set make make mani charact superfici ken barbi made palett bore grate one even despit point tri made individu the film also often lack light touch need captiv young girl actual play barbi doll wont necessarili understand high level commentari play even mum elder sister explain afterward
Better than expected,Being a huge barbie fan I had to go watch this movie and let me tell you it did not disappoint. Started as a fun kids movie but took a. Wry interesting turn with its story line.The display of patriarchy in real world using barbie land was so smartly done.A great direction with attention to details that makes this so much fun to watch.Some of the moments will make you burst out laughing and some will make you really emotional.It's a movie for every age group but absolutely a must watch for teenagers.My fiancé watched it with me who doesn't know anything about barbies but has a wonderful time.

"Funny And Good Cast, But Not This ""Great"" Movie Everyone's Been Saying","I wasn't dying to see this, but I felt like I had to participate in the Barbenheimer phenomenon, and the trailer looked good, so I went. I went in with reasonably high expectations because the reviews were high and it has a good cast and crew behind it. I was slightly disappointed.I enjoy Robbie's acting, and I also like Will Ferrell (who doesn't), it's got some good chuckles, the screenplay is solid. The soundtrack is also pretty good.Now, what's bad about it? Well, I felt like a film like this would be a tad more realistic then it was. This felt like an animated film inside a live action film. I feel like there were some parts that were unnecessary.Well, it was pretty good.

Not all is peachy when things get preachy,"It feels like its been some time since a film release has gripped the world quite like the way in which Barbie has over recent weeks/months, with the Greta Gerwig directed box office sensation creating a global phenomenon that has translated to record breaking openings in cinemas, critical plaudits and audience adoration on a scale that is mostly just a dream for Hollywood bigwigs.A talent-laden affair in front of the camera with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling leading the charge as plastic icons Barbie and Ken respectively and also behind the camera with Gerwig teaming up with her real life partner Noah Baumbach to bring Matel's beloved creation to life, Barbie is far better than it has any right to be as we explore Barbie Land and the real world with our protagonists, in what amounts to a pink fever dream that recalls old school Tim Burton at its peak, Barbie is also a little too heavy handed in the way in which it hammers home its messaging, making the film one that doesn't always correctly balance its oddball charm with preachy messaging.A film that in many ways had become too big too fail with anticipation around the one half of Barbenheimer (with the weighty Oppenheimer no doubt benefiting hugely from the cross promotion) reaching fever pitch levels all over the globe, the adoration aimed at Gerwig's film right now feels like the type of over the top praise that will be reevaluated in coming months/years too something more grounded, with Gerwig and her team deserving of praise for creating such a colourful world and giving us something that doesn't just feel like a two hour long toy commercial but also going over the top in its empowerment messaging that feels like a message swung too far into the direction of all men are patriarchal menaces who aren't deserving of the women in their lives.At its best when it allows its stars a chance to play within the confines of a likeable fish out of water tale where Barbie and Ken roam the boardwalks of Venice Beach adorned in skin tight Lycra or where Gosling's MVP performance as Ken see's the horse obsessed and Matchbox 20 loving beach bound man child bring too life a range of hilarious situations and sentiments, Barbie gets bogged down when it turns its attention to preaching too the converted and fails to make the most of its ""human"" characters like America Ferrera's Gloria or Will Ferrell's unnecessary tickle loving Mattel CEO, forgoing its comedic charms to try and be something it might naturally have become anyway had it dialled back the politics and just decided to be the fun escapist entertainment it often utilises.When fun and adventure is at the forefront of Barbie's agenda, Gerwig's film is an undeniable delight and you'd be hard pressed to recall a more colorful and playful film when Barbie is in full flight but with all the hyperbole coming thick and fast right at this moment in time, it's hard not too consider Barbie's public sentiments being blown up out of proportion as the films misses are overlooked in favour of viewers preferring to watch this cultural touchstone with a pair of (pink) rose-tinted glasses.Final Say -There's fun to be had from Barbie and the commitment of its two leads is a sight to behold, as is the world which Gerwig brings to life but when Barbie forgoes the fun and playfulness it thrives in in favour of repetitive messaging, the film becomes more of a slog than an enjoyment.3 Mojo Dojo Casa House's out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",not peachi thing get preachi,it feel like

"Good acting, good budget. Thats all that was good.","I think i laughed maybe twice. Michael cera was probably the best thing in the movie and he wasnt that funny here. Nothing made sense, there was a really random depiction of what i think was supposedly to be a stereotypical man but it was like a weird distorted version like a fever dream, just really off but just barely accurate enough to catch. I think it was supposed to be comedic. There was a random like half hour where they pretended only women have certain problems and that somehow realizing that broke the girls from a spell that men had put on them by acting in that feverish dream version of ""manly"".

The audiience seemed to like it,"Everything is perfect in Barbieland. Every day is identikit pink perfection for all the Barbies, and also for the Kens as long as they're getting attention. Then stereotypical Barbie starts getting dark thoughts, which can only be due to the human who is playing with her in the Real World. So, accompanied by Ken, Barbie sets off through the rip in reality to find the relevant human, only to find that the Real World is not at all like Barbieland. And Ken discovers patriarchy. And horses.As a film, this is an enjoyable mess. It aims to be toy nostalgia for little girls of all ages, escapist silliness, wild fantasy, social satire with well-staged musical production numbers, in fact a bizarre mix of elements which shoukdn't work together, but somehow do. It's bright, colourful, tuneful, quite funny, well played, sometimes thoughtful and thought-provoking, mikdly feminist (though not without taking pokes at feminism and vacuous femininity as well as toxic masculinity) and, broadly, good-hearted. Helen Mirren's narration is dry and funny, and the last line is a killer.Looking at the film as a social phenomenon, I have two observations. One, a lot of people have got their knickers in a twist, and they are mostly males who feel very threatened by the mildly feminist message in this movie ABOUT DOLLS. This film is not is big a deal as it thinks it is, and it's certainly not as big a deal as wounded males seem to think it is.

A much more emotional journey than I expected,"Leading up to the day I went to see this movie, I avoided as much advertising as I could as to avoid spoilers and go in entirely blind. But that being said, I learned very late that Greta Gerwig was the director of this film, and therefore, was not prepared for the emotional journey I was about to be taken through.This movie was unique, creative, fun, and so special. The music was excellent, the cast was wonderful, the costumes were amazing, it was funny, and the choreography was fun.As for it's flaws, this movie did have some uneven pacing. I felt that some side plot stuff was unnecessary (namely, most of the Mattel chase). Sometimes it was just very confusing for the sake of making audience members existential, the ending felt abrupt, and there was little justice by the end of the movie (though perhaps this was more of a conscious choice on behalf of the filmmakers to convey the endless, feminist fight).I was happy to see how this film really explored the female experience. From growing up to objectification by men. I was shocked to see Ken claim to love Barbie, only to objectify and hurt her later on; it was truly reminiscent of many elements in real life. Overall the tone and look of this movie was very unique and I enjoyed it a lot.I didn't expect to cry during the fun, silly Barbie movie I had been so excited to see, but I'm glad it was as emotional as it was.",a much emot journey i expect,lead day i went see movi i avoid much advertis i could avoid spoiler go entir blind but said i learn late greta gerwig director film therefor prepar emot journey i taken throughthi movi uniqu creativ fun special the music excel cast wonder costum amaz funni choreographi funa flaw movi uneven pace i felt side plot stuff unnecessari name mattel chase sometim confus sake make audienc member existenti end felt abrupt littl justic end movi though perhap consciou choic behalf filmmak convey endless feminist fighti happi see film realli explor femal experi from grow objectif men i shock see ken claim love barbi objectifi hurt later truli reminisc mani element real life overal tone look movi uniqu i enjoy loti didnt expect cri fun silli barbi movi i excit see im glad emot
Relevant and forgettable at the same time,"Yes, we have a socially relevant film, perhaps with topics already touched on in other works, but we must recognize that it was necessary to do it from the perspective, the seal and the criticism of and towards the figure of Barbie. The subjects touched on are explicitly verbalized in the film, it doesn't allow for such a deep analysis without being redundant with the message delivered.If we get into the technical fibers of the film, the script and the performance of Ryan Gosling is the highlight of the film. Unlike my fellow critics and cinephiles, I don't think Margot Robbie gave an awards-worthy performance. It's a good performance that meets the range that the script demands, but it's not particularly outstanding, as it was, for example, in Babylon.The direction work is conformist and the editing has a couple of visible errors. I'm not a fan of musicals, so in the end I ended up a little bored.Relevant film, to see once and look for something else.",relev forgett time,ye social relev film perhap topic alreadi touch work must recogn necessari perspect seal critic toward figur barbi the subject touch explicitli verbal film doesnt allow deep analysi without redund messag deliveredif get technic fiber film script perform ryan gosl highlight film unlik fellow critic cinephil i dont think margot robbi gave awardsworthi perform it good perform meet rang script demand particularli outstand exampl babylonth direct work conformist edit coupl visibl error im fan music end i end littl boredrelev film see look someth el
Genius! We need more movies like this one!,"Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig, is a satirical and surreal comedy masterpiece that subverts and celebrates the iconic doll and her world. It's a small art house film on a big blockbuster scale. It's something we need more. It deserves acclaim for that risk that Mattel, WB, Gerwig and all its Cast and Crew took. Margot Robbie stars as Barbie, a plastic perfectionist who struggles to fit in with the rigid expectations of her society. When she is expelled from Barbieland for not being flawless enough, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery in the real world, where she meets a diverse and colorful cast of characters who challenge and inspire her. Along the way, she learns to embrace her flaws, find her voice, and unleash her inner sparkle.Gerwig's direction is brilliant, balancing humor and heart with a sharp eye for detail and a playful sense of style. The film is full of witty references, clever jokes, and hilarious situations that poke fun at the absurdity and contradictions of Barbie's culture, while also honoring its legacy and appeal. The cinematography, production design, and costumes are stunning, creating a vibrant and immersive visual experience that contrasts the artificiality of Barbieland with the realism of the human world.Robbie's and Gosling's performance is outstanding, capturing both the innocence and the sass of Barbie, as well as her growth and transformation. Gosling shines so bright in this. His song is chef's kiss! They are supported by a stellar ensemble. Barbie is a film that will make you laugh, cry, and think. It is a smart and subversive commentary on gender, beauty, identity, and consumerism, as well as a tribute to the power of imagination, creativity, and individuality. It is a film that proves that anyone can be anything they want to be, as long as they are true to themselves. It is a film that deserves a 10/10 rating.

"Sometimes Very Good, Sometimes Not so Good","The film was entertaining enough but only just. I think if it hadn't had Ryan Gosling in it, it would have been something of a snore fest which is ironic as it was aimed to be a female vehicle.I understand the premise of Barbie wanting to go to the real world in order to find a cure of becoming human. However, it's not a very well rounded tale. There's the odd amusing scene throughout until the Ken dance/song near the end, which ends up being hilarious and has added a good two stars to my review.It takes itself a little bit too seriously at times when really it could have done with a bit more humor. Overall not bad.",sometim veri good sometim not good,the film entertain enough i think hadnt ryan gosl would someth snore fest iron aim femal vehiclei understand premis barbi want go real world order find cure becom human howev well round tale there odd amus scene throughout ken dancesong near end end hilari ad good two star reviewit take littl bit serious time realli could done bit humor overal bad
If only she hadn't preached at us...,"""Barbie"" is undoubtedly one of the most enjoyable films I've seen this year and yet it's also the most infuriating. Highly imaginative, (it's got the best pre-credit sequence in years), and laugh-out-loud funny it's got ideas to burn and therein lies the problem. Director and co-writer, (with partner Noah Baumbach), Greta Gerwig has set out to make the ultimate feminist tract dressed up in the brightest of pinks as a satire and while it works perfectly well as a satire full of self-conscious digs at its very creation, (we are constantly being reminded this is a movie called ""Barbie"" that we're watching), it's as a tract that it's in danger of sinking. That it doesn't is very much to Gerwig's credit; she's much too smart to really ruin her product and there is an awful lot here to enjoy.The thin plot has Barbie and Ken leaving Barbieland for the real world so Barbie can repair some sort of hole in the spectrum or some such nonsense that has allowed 'real' feelings (of a negative kind) to slip in and, naturally, since this is a film about dolls coming to life, it's decidedly silly and if had stayed silly it might have been inconsequential fun but Gerwig and Baumbach wants this to be 'consequential' fun, a laugh-a-minute message movie. Unfortunately one message doesn't appear to be enough; there were times I felt I was being battered to death by a giant message-wielding Barbie and by the time Will Ferrell's CEO of Mattel has left the real world for Barbieland the laughs had begun to dry up.Perhaps if someone had snipped about 20 minutes from the running time and dropped a few of the film's sermons this might have been the classic it was clearly aiming to be; that said, there are a lot of plusses here. It looks fantastic, the best gags are as good as anything Gerwig or Baumbach have given us in the past and best of all, it's got a couple of living dolls worthy of the name.Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, (there's even an in-joke about her in the movie), and, of course, she's wonderful and yet the film isn't hers. Barbie really belongs to Ryan Gosling who might become the first actor to be Oscar-nominated for playing a doll and given that the film is structured to make him a mouthpiece for its creators he brings an uncanny degree of feeling to the role and his performance is up there with his very best. As for Gerwig, maybe now that she's got her inner Barbie out of her system she might finally settle down to make comedies that are funny and meaningful and leave the sermons at home. We already know how good she can be.",if hadnt preach u,barbi undoubtedli one enjoy film ive seen year yet also infuri highli imagin got best precredit sequenc year laughoutloud funni got idea burn therein lie problem director cowrit partner noah baumbach greta gerwig set make ultim feminist tract dress brightest pink satir work perfectli well satir full selfconsci dig creation constantli remind movi call barbi watch tract danger sink that doesnt much gerwig credit she much smart realli ruin product aw lot enjoyth thin plot barbi ken leav barbieland real world barbi repair sort hole spectrum nonsens allow real feel neg kind slip natur sinc film doll come life decidedli silli stay silli might inconsequenti fun gerwig baumbach want consequenti fun laughaminut messag movi unfortun one messag doesnt appear enough time i felt i batter death giant messagewield barbi time will ferrel ceo mattel left real world barbieland laugh begun dri upperhap someon snip minut run time drop film sermon might classic clearli aim said lot plus it look fantast best gag good anyth gerwig baumbach given u past best got coupl live doll worthi namemargot robbi born play barbi there even injok movi cours she wonder yet film isnt barbi realli belong ryan gosl might becom first actor oscarnomin play doll given film structur make mouthpiec creator bring uncanni degre feel role perform best a gerwig mayb she got inner barbi system might final settl make comedi funni meaning leav sermon home we alreadi know good
Initially fun but there's lots to dislike,"I went to this movie just to see the eye candy of beautiful people and fanciful sets because, come on, who is more perfectly beautiful to portray Barbie than Margot Robbie? And who's more attractive to be Ken other than Ryan Gosling?This movie was too long, too wordy and too preachy to be for actual children. Which is odd since it's about the most iconic doll of all time.The creation of the Barbie world was awesome: sets and props. But the preachy and messy plot about the patriarchy didn't impress, and neither did the resolution of the story. How about promoting a world where neither men nor women have to have the majority of the power over each other? Some of the dialogue in this movie was literally incoherent babble. Also, they didn't have to pointedly throw in that Barbie was drinking cow milk- cow on the label in all caps. Are the writers anti vegan? At least they mentioned in the film to the audience that Ken was wearing faux fur, but it was like a condescending little note because I guess they assume people care more about fur industry animals than they do about the masses of exploited cows. Anyways, the best parts of this movie were: Ryan Gosling all the way (gorgeous, funny, singing and dancing,) the conflict between the two alpha Kens and introducing me to Simu Liu and Issa Rae. Despite its flaws, I'm glad I followed the hype and saw this movie. But I doubt I could sit through it again, it's just too silly and canned preachy.",initi fun there lot dislik,i went movi see eye candi beauti peopl fanci set come perfectli beauti portray barbi margot robbi and who attract ken ryan goslingthi movi long wordi preachi actual child which odd sinc icon doll timeth creation barbi world awesom set prop but preachi messi plot patriarchi didnt impress neither resolut stori how promot world neither men woman major power some dialogu movi liter incoher babbl also didnt pointedli throw barbi drink cow milk cow label cap are writer anti vegan at least mention film audienc ken wear faux fur like condescend littl note i guess assum peopl care fur industri anim mass exploit cow anyway best part movi ryan gosl way gorgeou funni sing danc conflict two alpha ken introduc simu liu issa rae despit flaw im glad i follow hype saw movi but i doubt i could sit silli can preachi
Wow. And not in a good way.,"I'm a big fan of Greta Gerwig and all the leading cast of Barbie, so I settled down to watch this with huge anticipation. Ten minutes in I realised I was going to be disappointed.What a hot mess.As an active lifelong feminist I truly understand and appreciate the howling rage that underpins this film, and there are glimpses of what it could have been - a few good jokes, the big 'beach off' scene, the juxtaposition between Barbie in her insane outfits and the lives of girls in the real world - but its message is delivered in a way that's just exhausting.The production design, colours and styling all scream 'FUN!! ISN'T THIS FUNNY? AREN'T WE HAVING FUN?', but sadly the answer to those questions is, um ... no. The vast production budget and strenuous efforts of the cast can't begin to compensate for the truly dreadful script and confused narrative.This is not satire used as a scalpel, with wit and a light touch; it's a big old sledgehammer with a flashing neon sign on it, and it bashes you over the head relentlessly with its back-to-back polemics and endless snark.At the end of the day I just can't work out who this film is for.Maybe as a remedial lesson in basic feminist theory and a lecture on how real the struggle is for women, it ticks some boxes.But as an engaging entertainment experience it falls way short, which is so, so disappointing given the brains, talent and money that was thrown at it. I've given it 5 just for the effort involved.",wow and good way,im big fan greta gerwig lead cast barbi i settl watch huge anticip ten minut i realis i go disappointedwhat hot messa activ lifelong feminist i truli understand appreci howl rage underpin film glimps could good joke big beach scene juxtaposit barbi insan outfit live girl real world messag deliv way that exhaustingth product design colour style scream fun isnt thi funni arent we have fun sadli answer question um the vast product budget strenuou effort cast cant begin compens truli dread script confus narrativethi satir use scalpel wit light touch big old sledgehamm flash neon sign bash head relentlessli backtoback polem endless snarkat end day i cant work film formayb remedi lesson basic feminist theori lectur real struggl woman tick boxesbut engag entertain experi fall way short disappoint given brain talent money thrown ive given effort involv
Barbie is everything,"Greta Gerwig, you've done it again. There's a reason this movie has become such a phenomenon in modern culture and that's because it's always been a hit!The writing is absolutely genius with the right mix of attention-to-detail and suspension of disbelief for the imagination. The cast is so random but that makes it perfect, there's a Barbie or Ken for everyone no matter what. Their acting is superb too, everyone's line delivery left me cracking up each time.Go to the cinema and watch this film - I was fortunate enough to go to a screening where everyone shared my excitement and there were cheers in the crowd and applause at the end. It's an experience I will never forget.

"Fantastic Concept, Plastic Execution","Written by Ian Chandler - July 21, 2023MILD spoilers ahead.""Barbie,"" directed by Greta Gerwig, is one of the most bizarre films in recent memory. A popular toy tailored at young girls gets a chance at being one of the year's best films. Its whimsical, funny marketing alongside its promising cast would suggest such. Unfortunately, the film botches that opportunity, but still has some fun moments. Even though it is not as funny as many other comedies, the film manages to stay in one's head after leaving the theater.From its colorful presentation to its glowing characters, Barbie's opening proposes that the movie will be roaringly entertaining. The music is great, the narration pokes fun at the Barbie brand, and the events are overly silly. Margot Robbie does a superb job at capturing the zany but stiff expressions one would expect from Barbie. Accompanying her is the equally funny Ken, who is played by Ryan Gosling. The two are fun to watch and their adventure appears to be one enjoyable time!Despite the promising opening, the film, like cheap plastic, breaks apart very quickly. Once Barbie and Ken go to the real world, the jokes are lazy and subplots are underexplored. The picture's demographic is also confusing. What looked like a kids' film with humor adults can enjoy ends up giving discomforting questions parents have to discuss with their children. (For example, what a penis or a vagina means.) The sporadic sexual humor lacks a proper set up which makes for a lackluster punchline, resulting in cringey moments that, at the moment, raise questions for who this film is tailored for.""Barbie"" also suffers from being a mostly directionless film, as its plot is unfocused but its message is very prominent. It sets up around three plotlines that were likely pitched individually and crams them all into one story with none of these concepts receiving their proper conclusions. It makes for a frustrating ending. The moral is also confusing and seems to spark more of a negative message than a positive one. Instead of the conflicts being resolved where everyone lives in harmony, it is a tug-o-war on which sex has the right to be selfish. It may make some viewers, especially impressionable children, think lower of both sexes or believe their gender is superior or inferior to the other. It may also cause some unnecessary dispute on the internet.How characters grow is another misstep from Gerwig. Many characters do not develop gradually, but abruptly. Barbie, Ken, and two other leading characters are almost unrecognizable to their third-act counterparts. It is difficult to root for any of them as they all aim to achieve their selfish desires instead of coming up with a plan where everyone is happy. If the characters were likable and the overall message was less overboard, it could have matched the quality its marketing advised.Even if it is a bit of a disappointment, there were some laugh-out-loud moments. Fourth-wall breaking jokes were well placed and parodies of other films or events were a joy. The production and music almost make up for the aimless story as it stays true to the brand but also makes the newer ideas feel fresh and organic. The choreography in some sequences is exceptional and, like its presentation, reinstates how fun Barbie and friends can be when it treats itself as a lighthearted comedy. It really could have been great if it were to stay in one direction.Barbie - 65/100

Life in plastic isn't all that fantastic,"I was looking forward to seeing Barbie. It was on my list of most-anticipated movies and I had heard so many good things about it. But Barbie let me down. I wish that the filmmakers had put as much effort into the screenplay as they did the sets, costumes, and Barbie references. Barbie has a really fun look, but the plot seems like it was cobbled together by seven-year-olds and then coated with a layer of cynicism. Barbie also isn't as humorous as I expected it to be. I think I only laughed out loud once. And most of the jokes feel like lectures. I guess life in plastic isn't all that fantastic.",life plastic isnt fantast,i look forward see barbi it list mostanticip movi i heard mani good thing but barbi let i wish filmmak put much effort screenplay set costum barbi refer barbi realli fun look plot seem like cobbl togeth sevenyearold coat layer cynic barbi also isnt humor i expect i think i laugh loud and joke feel like lectur i guess life plastic isnt fantast
Surprisingly Good,"I wasn't expecting much, but this movie is great! It's a smart comedy. The film is clearly feminist, but it is NOT ""preachy"" as some other reviewer complained. Yes, there is one speech, but it's not made by a Barbie. It fits into the story.The film mines the Barbie and Ken existence of ""life"" as a plastic doll for comedic effect, with some song and dance sequences as a bonus. But it's mainly about an existential crisis for the main Barbie (Margot Robbie), who travels to the ""Real World"" to resolve her crisis. Events in both the ""Real World"" and the Barbie world drive the plot, which concerns the collision between the ideal and the real. The dramatic conflict centers on the contradiction between the ideal world of the Barbies and the disappointing, yet also tempting, reality of our world--the Real World. I thought the last scene was perfect and perhaps slyly politically incorrect. You can judge for yourself. I only didn't like the music played over the end credits. The song and dance numbers in the film were entertaining though.",surprisingli good,i wasnt expect much movi great it smart comedi the film clearli feminist not preachi review complain ye one speech made barbi it fit storyth film mine barbi ken exist life plastic doll comed effect song danc sequenc bonu but mainli existenti crisi main barbi margot robbi travel real world resolv crisi event real world barbi world drive plot concern collis ideal real the dramat conflict center contradict ideal world barbi disappoint yet also tempt realiti worldth real world i thought last scene perfect perhap slyli polit incorrect you judg i didnt like music play end credit the song danc number film entertain though
Not recommendable,"I wouldn't recommend this to any of my friends. I probably put too much expectations on this movie.It does not have any interesting stories at all. I keep watching, but the cliche just keeps going on and on. I agreed with most of the lines in the movies by the way. But still, you can definitely tell what kind of message the director is trying to convey. It's very straightforward. Nothing really surprises me.If this movie got any reward, then it would be a big shame for the movie industry. I love feminism movies, but this one is just a commercial gimmick to generate more interests from all these recent heated topics.",not recommend,i wouldnt recommend friend i probabl put much expect movieit interest stori i keep watch clich keep go i agre line movi way but still definit tell kind messag director tri convey it straightforward noth realli surpris meif movi got reward would big shame movi industri i love femin movi one commerci gimmick gener interest recent heat topic
Fantastic attention to details,"This movie, about Barbie who suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence, is a good fantasy movie!I liked the concept, and it reminded me of The Toy Story Quadrilogy (1995-2019). The dolls were living dolls, but they were existing in their own reality separated from ours. The sense of humor were present, and I noticed that this movie was targeted for both children and adults in several ways. Its satire was well used, and it was frequently entertaining throughout the runtime. The attention to details was fantastic because of the script, the action, the minor details, like eating and drinking, and last, but not least: the sets and the effects - every visual element, basically. The characters' behaviors were like they were controlled by kids, but we didn't see the kids' hands or like that. They acted like they were played with, and that was well executed, I think.I think the story was alright. The outer story in the first and third act was good. The beginning contained a great representation of the characters and their story while the ending went deep into the inner story about the foundation of Barbie and how Barbie has affected people before, but also how Barbie should affect us in the right way today. It's all about accepting the life with its positivities and negativities, but also to believe in causes and to put yourself in others' shoes, because that's how to live as a realistic, self-controlled being. The second act is a big part of a movie, and I got mixed feelings about that act in this movie. It had its meanings, but I think much of what happened, especially in Los Angeles, was sometimes messy and unnecessary. It was much small-talk, and I sometimes got the feeling that some scenes dragged the time. Anyway, it didn't ruin the overall experience.In conclusion, this movie delivers an imaginative and entertaining story. The attention to detail, from the script to the visual elements, enhances the overall experience. The movie's satirical approach appeals to both children and adults, making it a delightful watch for diverse audiences. While the outer story is well-crafted, the second act could have benefited from tighter pacing. Nevertheless, the movie's exploration of Barbie's impact on people's lives and the themes of acceptance and empathy are commendable. Despite minor flaws, the movie succeeds in captivating its viewers and encourages us to reflect on our own existence and the importance of understanding others.",fantast attent detail,thi movi barbi suffer crisi lead question world exist good fantasi moviei like concept remind the toy stori quadrilog the doll live doll exist realiti separ the sen humor present i notic movi target child adult sever way it satir well use frequent entertain throughout runtim the attent detail fantast script action minor detail like eat drink last least set effect everi visual element basic the charact behavior like control kid didnt see kid hand like they act like play well execut i thinki think stori alright the outer stori first third act good the begin contain great represent charact stori end went deep inner stori foundat barbi barbi affect peopl also barbi affect u right way today it accept life posit neg also believ caus put other shoe that live realist selfcontrol the second act big part movi i got mix feel act movi it mean i think much happen especi lo angel sometim messi unnecessari it much smalltalk i sometim got feel scene drag time anyway didnt ruin overal experiencein conclus movi deliv imagin entertain stori the attent detail script visual element enhanc overal experi the movi satir approach appeal child adult make delight watch diver audienc while outer stori wellcraft second act could benefit tighter pace nevertheless movi explor barbi impact peopl live theme accept empathi commend despit minor flaw movi succe captiv viewer encourag u reflect exist import understand other

"[6.8] Great rosy start, mild yellow-gray continuation","A nice, childish movie deserving around 6 as the rating, but as I enjoyed it mildly and sometimes more than averagely it gets a nice and commendable 6.8 rounded up to 7.The star and highlight of the movie is of course Margot Robbie and if Ken, his male counterpart had the same charisma and aura it would have become so great.In fact the Barbies are very good generally, whereas the Ken s are not, bland, generic, sometimes cliche and only the main Ken shines because of his persona, but is dissolved in the treacherous script, screenplay and plots.The movie should have been all rosy , photography, cinematography and screenplay alike. Unfortunately, the plots and some gray acting ruined those , especially in the last 60-45 minutes to the very end.For once, a movie should have been all dolls and Barbie's existential crisis threw a tasteless blanket of gray flowers and artificiality onto their awesome world.Screenplay/storyline: 6

Barbie has an existential crisis,"Barbie is a really fun movie that all ages can enjoy because while it's colourful and entertaining the main storyline can get emotional at times. The comedy in the movie is pretty funny too and got a few laughs from everyone in the cinema, the music is really nice and so are the choreographed dances. What I liked the most about this movie is that it was very doll-like, the food and drink were plastic and fake, the cars didn't have engines and just glided along the floor, and the actors were doll-like in their movements and how they interacted with their environment.The sheer amount of details that are in this movie is amazing, from the clothes, the wide variety of dolls, cars, pets, houses, and even down to the accessories were a perfect match to what's being sold or what has been sold in the past. On another note, I was not expecting the plot twist and the antagonist to be revealed, but that's what I liked about this movie, I went in thinking to know what this movie was going to be about but I was wrong and was surprised. As the movie progresses you find yourself enjoying it more and more, it's well paced and it has a good story so I definitely recommend it!",barbi existenti crisi,barbi realli fun movi age enjoy colour entertain main storylin get emot time the comedi movi pretti funni got laugh everyon cinema music realli nice choreograph danc what i like movi dolllik food drink plastic fake car didnt engin glide along floor actor dolllik movement interact environmentth sheer amount detail movi amaz cloth wide varieti doll car pet hous even accessori perfect match what sold sold past on anoth note i expect plot twist antagonist reveal that i like movi i went think know movi go i wrong surpris a movi progress find enjoy well pace good stori i definit recommend
"If you want it, here it is. Come and get it.","No doubt you've spent a few months hearing about Barbenheimer, referring to the simultaneous releases of Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" and Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"". Obviously the movies couldn't be more different. I saw ""Oppenheimer"" last weekend, as arms control experts had recommended seeing it before ""Barbie"" after all, she lives in the world that he helped bring about.Anyway, this movie addresses the issue of how we define gender roles, and of course looks at matriarchy versus patriarchy. The plot actually reminded me of the 2007 Disney flick ""Enchanted"", with the idea of an ultra-feminine character from an apparently perfect world suddenly coming to the real world.All in all, it's an over-the-top but enjoyable flick. You'll probably leave the theater asking yourself what it means to be a man or a woman. Along with Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, the cast includes America Ferrera, Simu Liu, Emma Mackey, Ncuti Gatwa, Kate McKinnon, Will Ferrell, Helen Mirren and Michael Cera. Therefore, the supporting cast makes this movie a link between ""Ugly Betty"", ""Kim's Convenience"", ""Sex Education"" (twice), ""Ghostbusters"", ""Anchorman"", ""Prime Suspect"" and ""Arrested Development"".",if want come get,no doubt youv spent month hear barbenheim refer simultan releas christoph nolan oppenheim greta gerwig barbi obvious movi couldnt differ i saw oppenheim last weekend arm control expert recommend see barbi live world help bring aboutanyway movi address issu defin gender role cours look matriarchi versu patriarchi the plot actual remind disney flick enchant idea ultrafeminin charact appar perfect world suddenli come real worldal overthetop enjoy flick youll probabl leav theater ask mean man woman along margot robbi barbi ryan gosl ken cast includ america ferrera simu liu emma mackey ncuti gatwa kate mckinnon will ferrel helen mirren michael cera therefor support cast make movi link ugli betti kim conveni sex educ twice ghostbust anchorman prime suspect arrest develop
A missed opportunity,"Great visuals but the 'plot' felt like a bunch of stale ideas that the writers were desperate to include but hadn't really thought through. A real missed opportunity to take the discussion forward about changing society's gendered expectations for both men and women. Instead the writers chose our existing system - but with women 'in charge' - as the final outcome even though they had a whole imaginary world at their disposal to explore an alternative. This was not a kid's film but it was quite a childish treatment of an important topic. I fell for the marketing campaign though! It it got me excited to see the film and buy a ticket, but the 'bait and switch' nature of the campaign left me confused and disappointed.",a miss opportun,great visual plot felt like bunch stale idea writer desper includ hadnt realli thought a real miss opportun take discus forward chang societi gender expect men woman instead writer chose exist system woman charg final outcom even though whole imaginari world dispos explor altern thi kid film quit childish treatment import topic i fell market campaign though it got excit see film buy ticket bait switch natur campaign left confus disappoint
A Great Comedy & Satire,"Opens with a great tribute to 2001: a Space Odyssey's ape sequence, setting the scene for the humour and satire to follow. Barbie and Ken escape from Barbieland into the real world, threatening societal breakdown in both as changes in one universe affects the other. Barbieland is effectively a Matriarchy where girls rule and the Kens just do Beach, play sports, stand around and try to attract the attention of the Barbies. There are all types of Barbies, President Barbie, the Supreme Court Barbie, Roadworker Barbies. Margot Robbie is Stereotypical Barbie with Ryan Gosling as her Beach Ken. They travel to the real world after Barbie starts developing cellulite and worrying about death. Ken learns about patriarchy in the real world, especially from the clever corporate types who affect an image of equality but use this as a cover to carry on in the old manner. Ken returns to Barbieland intent on turning it into a Kendom and turning the world upside down. Barbie faces the all male Executive board of Mattel where the CEO (Ken Ferrell) defends his policies but literally tries to put Batbie in a box. . Cutting satire, great humour in a whipsmart script with wonderful fake pastel sets in Barbieland. The themes and set decoration bring Don't Worry Darling and Asteroid City to mind. Kate McKinnon is Weird Barbie who helps Stereotypical Barbie to solve her personal problems and to battle against the Kendom. I'll have to see this again.

6 for trying - SOLID IDEAS HERE,"I had moderate to slightly high expectations and that's what I got... well, maybe a little less.I'm no film expert or critique. As a woman, a teacher and a mom, I was happy that Mattel took this step toward addressing the ""stereotypical"" image of Barbie which is said to have impacted how young girls have judged themselves for many years.Throughout the recent years, you would see Barbies of various races, but (to my knowledge) always skinny, with pointy feet, fashionable (mostly rather revealing) clothes and a face full of make-up.So, yes, it remains a question to be answered, but this movie didn't seem like it covered it all.For example, the film starts with reminding us that pre-Barbie, little girls played with ""baby dolls"", not an adult, make-up wearing, fashionably-clothed Barbie.This question is never addressed in the film again.Even for teens and adults, this film seems like it has so many great ideas, but it doesn't know where it's going.Plotline seemed a bit convoluted to me.Lastly, I hope that making this movie was not an effort by Mattel to sell more Barbies.",tri solid idea here,i moder slightli high expect that i got well mayb littl lessim film expert critiqu a woman teacher mom i happi mattel took step toward address stereotyp imag barbi said impact young girl judg mani yearsthroughout recent year would see barbi variou race knowledg alway skinni pointi foot fashion mostli rather reveal cloth face full makeupso ye remain question answer movi didnt seem like cover allfor exampl film start remind u prebarbi littl girl play babi doll adult makeup wear fashionablycloth barbiethi question never address film againeven teen adult film seem like mani great idea doesnt know goingplotlin seem bit convolut melastli i hope make movi effort mattel sell barbi
"Not the evil propaganda some people are saying, but also not funny and very shallow","I just watched Barbie, it wasn't offensively bad. It was just weak, and not funny. The feminist rant stuff is unapologetically there, not as frequent as some people are saying, it came across to me like content from an '80s female stand up comedienne, so nothing original, and very dated. The script is messy and doesn't make a lot of sense even regarding it's own internal logic.The ""empowerment"" stuff in it is very generic, a lot of the sentiment is kid's film-level ""just be yourself and like yourself"" thinking that applies to any person, but it's only the girls in the film that make these profound ""revelations"" as they are the creative gender and the guys (in Barbie land and the ""real"" world) are all cardboard cut-out airheads.The film is nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is, it's pretty shallow and light-weight and isn't going to leave lasting impact in pop culture, good or bad, pretty forgettable really. Kids of an impressionable age will most likely just be bored by it, and most older people will see it for the weak sauce it is.",not evil propaganda peopl say also funni shallow,i watch barbi wasnt offens bad it weak funni the feminist rant stuff unapologet frequent peopl say came across like content femal stand comedienn noth origin date the script messi doesnt make lot sen even regard intern logicth empower stuff gener lot sentiment kid filmlevel like think appli person girl film make profound revel creativ gender guy barbi land real world cardboard cutout airheadsth film nowher near clever think pretti shallow lightweight isnt go leav last impact pop cultur good bad pretti forgett realli kid impression age like bore older peopl see weak sauc
So fun and charming!,"So i've just got back from theaters and all i got to say is wow, that was such a fun, funny, charming movie and the Barbie world was just so colorful ! ( which we knew from the trailers )Now before you say
anything... no, this movie doesn't hate men, if anything it understands men's struggles just as much as women's, i was scared that the movie whould demonizes(?) Ken too much but he was really funny and you could see where he was coming from, with him always being in Barbie's shadows and all thatSpeaking of Barbie, Margot Robbie is the perfect Barbie, she was so perfect that now i have difficulties imagining anyone else as the role of a life action Barbie, and look, i'm not saying this is the best movie of the year but for now... it's the one i liked the most.",so fun charm,so ive got back theater got say wow fun funni charm movi barbi world color knew trailer now say anyth movi doesnt hate men anyth understand men struggl much woman scare movi whould demon ken much realli funni could see come alway barbi shadow thatspeak barbi margot robbi perfect barbi perfect difficulti imagin anyon el role life action barbi look im say best movi year one like
I have mixed feelings about the film Barbie...but the overall look was fantastic!,"I like most American girls raised in the 70's and 80's had a Barbie. I also had a Ken, but he was short lived as he had an unfortunate accident that led to his beheading. Having said that I loved the overall look of this film...it was fantastic. The pink was spot on, the Barbie convertible, her Malibu dream house, even the packaging of the Barbie box was so perfect it brought back a strange nostalgia for my childhood gone. The music was good...but I was saddened that they didn't use Aqua's song Barbie Girl for the film.I loved both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. I thought they were perfect in their roles as classic 1980's Barbie and Ken. I was entertained by some of the comedy...like Barbie's feet going flat, the trip to ""the real world"" concluding in them on roller skates on Venice Beach, Ken thinking the patriarchy had something to do with horses, the concept of misfit Barbie...which everyone has seen at least one of, the self mockery around failed Mattel products like earring magic Ken-pregnant Midge-Palm Beach Sugar Daddy Ken, and I loved the on going joke about ""who's Allan?"".I thought the whole scene with the introduction of Barbie in its 2001 A Space Odyssey format was fantastic and realistic for the sentiment of its introduction.Where I started to fall off enjoyment-wise was in the degradation of Ken/Kens, who were made to be nothing more than himbos/mimbos who didn't exist except for when Barbie turned her attention onto him making him this obsequious idiot.Conceptually I liked the idea behind the Barbie's experience being tied to the girl playing with her (as is reality) and I enjoyed classic 80's Barbie's disillusionment with the real world where women weren't really anything they wanted to be...like for example there wasn't a single woman on the Mattel board. By the way I loved Will Ferrell! I didn't know he was in the film and that was a pleasant surprise.Where everything really went south for me was when the real mother and daughter team up with the Barbies in Barbie World to distract Ken's so they can reprogram the Barbies, deploying such tactics as feigning ignorance and interest. I found that to be a sad fiction imitating reality moment that just didn't sit well with me...and then I was equally annoyed with all of the current political sentiments being added in.Overall however I think you should watch the film, so this is a recommendation from me...but I probably will never watch it again.My favorite scene in the whole film is right after a teenage girl at a table full of obnoxious and disgruntled teenage girls in counter culture garb tell Barbie that she is what is wrong with the world and that she has ruined their lives...dejectedly and with tears 80's Barbie sits on a bench where there happens to be an older grey haired lady (no one ages in Barbie world) and she says to her ""you are beautiful"" and the older woman responds simply ""I know"". As a woman I wish that was reality...but in reality women aren't allowed to show their age in Hollywood and are expected to continually look young spurning industries of plastic surgery and cosmetics and cosmetic procedures and diets etc. I wish we as a culture and a nation thought older women were beautiful...and I wish they knew it, making that scene bittersweet...but my favorite part of the whole film.",i mix feel film barbiebut overal look fantast,i like american girl rais barbi i also ken short live unfortun accid led behead have said i love overal look filmit fantast the pink spot barbi convert malibu dream hous even packag barbi box perfect brought back strang nostalgia childhood gone the music goodbut i sadden didnt use aqua song barbi girl filmi love margot robbi ryan gosl i thought perfect role classic barbi ken i entertain comedylik barbi foot go flat trip real world conclud roller skate venic beach ken think patriarchi someth hors concept misfit barbiewhich everyon seen least one self mockeri around fail mattel product like ear magic kenpregn midgepalm beach sugar daddi ken i love go joke who allani thought whole scene introduct barbi a space odyssey format fantast realist sentiment introductionwher i start fall enjoymentwis degrad kenken made noth himbosmimbo didnt exist except barbi turn attent onto make obsequi idiotconceptu i like idea behind barbi experi tie girl play realiti i enjoy classic barbi disillusion real world woman werent realli anyth want belik exampl wasnt singl woman mattel board by way i love will ferrel i didnt know film pleasant surprisewher everyth realli went south real mother daughter team barbi barbi world distract ken reprogram barbi deploy tactic feign ignor interest i found sad fiction imit realiti moment didnt sit well meand i equal annoy current polit sentiment ad inoveral howev i think watch film recommend mebut i probabl never watch againmi favorit scene whole film right teenag girl tabl full obnoxi disgruntl teenag girl counter cultur garb tell barbi wrong world ruin livesdejectedli tear barbi sit bench happen older grey hair ladi one age barbi world say beauti older woman respond simpli i know a woman i wish realitybut realiti woman arent allow show age hollywood expect continu look young spurn industri plastic surgeri cosmet cosmet procedur diet etc i wish cultur nation thought older woman beautifuland i wish knew make scene bittersweetbut favorit part whole film
"The ""American Psycho"" of this generation.","Barbie is one of those few films that are able to merge an extremely unreal and borderline bizarre environment with an immensely grounded and hyperreal take on society successfully, and still be massively entertaining.The script is one of the finest in the history of film and demands supreme attention of the audience, not just to the surface level occurrences and dialogues but also to the underlying subtext (paralleling American Psycho).Contrary to the general consensus, this is very much a coming-of-age movie through the eyes of a young girl. Barbie has an idealistic and perfect outlook towards life which gets crushed and she is forced to accept, then gradually embrace and finally manoeuvre through.The film is also vastly political in nature (not just gender but otherwise too), compelling the idealistic society to realise how fractured their own internal workings are resulting in them implementing real life political resolutions to their systems.There are so many more layers to peel off of the writing which elevates this movie from a straightforward comedy/satire to a film that deserves to be broken apart piece by piece and studied extensively for generations to come (sooo very similar to American Psycho).And finally, Ryan Gosling does indeed deliver the absolute most sublime performance of his career.",the american psycho gener,barbi one film abl merg extrem unreal borderlin bizarr environ immens ground hyperr take societi success still massiv entertainingth script one finest histori film demand suprem attent audienc surfac level occurr dialogu also underli subtext parallel american psychocontrari gener consensu much comingofag movi eye young girl barbi idealist perfect outlook toward life get crush forc accept gradual embrac final manoeuvr throughth film also vastli polit natur gender otherwis compel idealist societi realis fractur intern work result implement real life polit resolut systemsther mani layer peel write elev movi straightforward comedysatir film deserv broken apart piec piec studi extens gener come sooo similar american psychoand final ryan gosl inde deliv absolut sublim perform career

I didn't expect it to be so funny, so we'll written, I just thought it would be okay and a bit cheesy but no. Truly a great film but there are a few jokes that might go over young kids heads, as well as some of the references.

Well made movie but a little uneven,"Barbie was a fun movie and it visually looked really original. There were some really funny parts and some good acting. I loved some of the throwbacks and songs. Really was laughing at some of the funny moments.The story and pacing was a little off and uneven for me. Couple of the characters felt a little flat to me, but overall it was a well made movie. Some of the songs were really great and the camera work was really good as well. I wish the story felt a little more connected overall. The tone really shifted around a bunch of times and it got a bit distracting. A movie can be funny and serious.. but it just didn't seem to know what tone it wanted to be and was a bit conflicting to me. Overall still enjoyed myself.",well made movi littl uneven,barbi fun movi visual look realli origin there realli funni part good act i love throwback song realli laugh funni momentsth stori pace littl uneven coupl charact felt littl flat overal well made movi some song realli great camera work realli good well i wish stori felt littl connect overal the tone realli shift around bunch time got bit distract a movi funni seriou didnt seem know tone want bit conflict overal still enjoy
Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,"This film thinks it's the Lego Movie but is far more akin to Don't Worry Darling. Starting off in a Matriarchal society, '60s feminist paradise where every position in society is ran by women (this is never shown as oppressive or questionable) saturated with the neon pinks and pastel purples, quintessentially American and girly. All Kens are sidelined and have no meaning they are jealous of one another and simp over Barbie. Through the course of the film this paradigm is spun on its head and put back to how it was again, no fantastical change happens to this world once it is changed and fought over and won back again by the Barbies.Vapid and confused are just a few words to sum up this movie. Misandrist should be just as common as misogynist in today's vocabulary; if any film of this generation portrayed women as servile, useless, and toxic it would be slammed across the board. However in this film woman are both victorious and the victim; the oppressed and oppressor; the can-haves and the cannots. Barbie wants its pink empowered cake and wants to eat it too.I didn't expect a pro masculine message from a Barbie movie, but I also didn't expect this when asked to accompany my girlfriend. I would also never expect any woman to sit through a film that took swings and berated their gender. Is this movie harmful? Yes, a generation will be brought up to hate their fathers, brothers, and even sons. This burns bridges rather than mends them or creates new ones. It feels like a trojan horse when compared to its advertising.Many will tell you it has brains, is well written and is a fascinating commentary on society -some of that may be true. Though if truth be told it is a confused and confusing film. A feminist utopia would have women in every possible position in society, and shocked to see there were construction barbies however that no building had exterior walls or any use of windows... I don't know what this says, but the optics don't look well. The fantasy land portrayed is truly fantasy and I hope every viewer realises that.",wolf sheep cloth,thi film think lego movi far akin dont worri darl start matriarch societi feminist paradis everi posit societi ran woman never shown oppress question satur neon pink pastel purpl quintessenti american girli all ken sidelin mean jealou one anoth simp barbi through cours film paradigm spun head put back fantast chang happen world chang fought back barbiesvapid confus word sum movi misandrist common misogynist today vocabulari film gener portray woman servil useless toxic would slam across board howev film woman victori victim oppress oppressor canhav can not barbi want pink empow cake want eat tooi didnt expect pro masculin messag barbi movi i also didnt expect ask accompani girlfriend i would also never expect woman sit film took swing berat gender is movi harm ye gener brought hate father brother even son thi burn bridg rather mend creat new one it feel like trojan hors compar advertisingmani tell brain well written fascin commentari societi may true though truth told confus confus film a feminist utopia would woman everi possibl posit societi shock see construct barbi howev build exterior wall use window i dont know say optic dont look well the fantasi land portray truli fantasi i hope everi viewer realis

Plastic Perils: A Hollow Venture into Doll-Dom,"""Barbie (2023)"" attempted to mold a modern narrative around the iconic doll, but what unraveled was a feature film that was as plastic and hollow as the toy it's inspired by. The film sets forth with a glittery promise of self-discovery and empowerment but stumbles and falls face-first into a puddle of clichés and superficiality.The protagonist's journey from a boxed perfection to a self-realized individual is filled with predictable plot twists and eye-roll-inducing dialogues. The script seems to be churned out from a factory of trite, lacking any originality or depth, much like the molded plastic of a Barbie doll.The animation, touted as one of the highlights, is nothing more than a barrage of pastel colors and unrealistic body proportions. It fails to breathe life into the characters or the world around them, making it a plastic paradise devoid of any genuine emotion or relatability.Supporting characters are as one-dimensional as they come, each embodying a blatant stereotype without any redeeming qualities. They flutter through the scenes, contributing nothing to the narrative other than filling the already cluttered screen.The attempt to modernize Barbie and make her relatable to the contemporary audience is a lost cause as the essence of what makes Barbie iconic is buried under a heap of modern-day jargon and misplaced attempts at humor.The villain, a caricature of societal expectations, is as menacing as a bubble wrap, failing to evoke any real threat or concern.Barbie is a missed opportunity to delve into the evolving identity and societal expectations of women. Instead, it serves a shallow, glitter-coated narrative that's as fleeting and forgettable as a fashion trend. In trying to find Barbie's place in the modern world, the film loses its way and ends up being a lackluster parade of plasticity.",plastic peril a hollow ventur dolldom,barbi attempt mold modern narr around icon doll unravel featur film plastic hollow toy inspir the film set forth glitteri promis selfdiscoveri empower stumbl fall facefirst puddl clich superficialityth protagonist journey box perfect selfreal individu fill predict plot twist eyerollinduc dialogu the script seem churn factori trite lack origin depth much like mold plastic barbi dollth anim tout one highlight noth barrag pastel color unrealist bodi proport it fail breath life charact world around make plastic paradis devoid genuin emot relatabilitysupport charact onedimension come embodi blatant stereotyp without redeem qualiti they flutter scene contribut noth narr fill alreadi clutter screenth attempt modern barbi make relat contemporari audienc lost caus essenc make barbi icon buri heap modernday jargon misplac attempt humorth villain caricatur societ expect menac bubbl wrap fail evok real threat concernbarbi miss opportun delv evolv ident societ expect woman instead serv shallow glitterco narr that fleet forgett fashion trend in tri find barbi place modern world film lose way end lacklust parad plastic
A JOLLY LIFE IN PINK IS GLITTERING & HEART-STIRRING,"Greta's satire that evidently seems like a promotion run of Mattel's creations, is beyond the pink dazzle. The sugary-adorable pastels, mostly the pink colour spreads all over the dreamy world of Barbie. Everything that makes it fancy, fizzy and fantastic are the production designs and costumes. Ebullience is lightened by the sparkling musical sequences. The Fabulous Margot Robbie as Barbie is the eminence of this Greta's clever and creative vision. The Cast is typically perfect to saturate in the fantasy. Ryan Gosling charmingly lends a kenergy in the story. The ridiculous banters strives all the way, sometimes little silly but mostly unveils the story's themes. There's a brief mention of Mattel's creation & how they flawed at a place when they aimed to represent a powerful figure. There's a slight malfunction between the fantasy and real world that alters different ideologies to flourish in the fun and laughs. The ideologies shapes into leading an unresolved fragment of humankind. The two contrasting portraits, the Patriarchy & Feminism comes in a fairy tale that once again liberalise the women and evokes them to voice up for themselves and their dilemmas & demands for a treaty for their existence and admiration which is partly void in the flawed-society. The sweet messages are beneath the glaring pink world, that adds a soul in the story. Barbie's exploration in finding the answer to the malfunction leads to many errands along the way. She realises the elegance of tears, her purpose and worth, being imperfect is normal and ultimately the self-discovery immerses in the conclusion. A pink jest is a celebration of womanhood as the flashes of memories flow. Gradually it reaches to hearts of millions with its resembling storytelling. It turns into a tender-mellow tale of Barbie, growing up to understand the sentiments of a human much more. Indeed this elegantly crafted and insightfully written tale drives to a sentimental ending.

No questions just answers,"The title of the review practically sums it all up. With the highest potential in style, aesthetics, cast and concept, the movie fails spectacularly when it comes to the deliverance of it's main idea. And it's not feminism that bothers, surely not, it's the artistic language in which the idea is told - harsh, manipulative, abusive, straightforward and unkind. Instead of aspiring the audience to think and reflect, it shoves the manifestations down your throat, and in monologues that are generally painfully awkward to watch.However, the opening scene is great (if you know the reference, of course), and there are some funny moments. But they seem to go against the general idea rather than to support it.",no question answer,the titl review practic sum with highest potenti style aesthet cast concept movi fail spectacularli come deliver main idea and femin bother sure artist languag idea told harsh manipul abus straightforward unkind instead aspir audienc think reflect shove manifest throat monologu gener pain awkward watchhowev open scene great know refer cours funni moment but seem go gener idea rather support
Funny and entertaining but kind of a mess,"The Barbie movie is a very mixed bag. It tries to appeal to both young girls and adults it seems, but this leads it to be very inconsistent with its humor. Margot Robbie does a fantastic job as Barbie and especially the opening works really well in highlighting the absurdity of Barbie's world, where its houses are all open and have no stairs, and its showers have no water and the fridge is filled with a drawing of groceries. All that works fantastic. But mixed into this is a lot of adult humor and sexual innuendo, which makes for a strange mix. It isn't until after the first act, where the movie tries to be more than just a movie about toys, that it kind of falls apart.The Barbie movie has a lot to say about gender rolls, and that is probably a healthy thing for the audience (even men) to think about. But if you are a male viewer, and if all you took from this movie is that ""it hates men"", then you completely missed the point. The movie critiques the role of men and women in society and it also critiques Barbie dolls and their depiction of what a girl should be. It pokes fun at it, while never completely turning against Barbie as a product. This is a Barbie movie after all. That this toy movie tries to be more than what one might expect out of such a film, is a good thing, including criticizing gender stereotypes. But the execution leaves more to be desired.There is plenty to critique about the Barbie movie that is valid. The Barbie movie tries to do a lot of things, and especially towards the third act it becomes kind of a mess. The movie could have benefited from a bit more focus. Instead, it is all over the place.Just the plot of Barbie and Ken being confronted with the real world, probably would have been enough for a whole movie. But to the movie's credit, it wants to be more than what the audience expects out of a Barbie movie. I would argue, too much.There's the plot of Mattel trying to capture Barbie, with the awkwardness of a Mattel product (what this movie is) critiquing Mattel. It never feels entirely earnest.Then there's the plot of Barbie seeking out the child she belongs to and reconnecting with her. This plot works the best, but it is kind of undermined by everything else that is going on.Then there's the side plot of Barbie meeting her creator, which at first feels like a random easter egg, but then later is brought back again towards the end of the movie, without really fitting in with all the other plots. The Barbie movie is very inconsistent regarding which world is magical and which is not. At first it seems as if Barbie-land is the place that is magical and unrealistic, which during the opening is the source of a lot of humor. Once Barbie and Ken visit the real world, the contrast leads to more humor. But then they start mixing in magical elements in the real world, and things become very messy. Such as Mattel having a mysterious floor where Barbie's deceased creator is still alive. This is later explained away as a haunting with a throw away line, but that doesn't quite explain it either. The movie seems to forget which of the two was the magical world and this ends up undermining the world building. It was a side plot we didn't need in the first place.Then there is the plot of Ken realizing men rule the world and learning traditional male stereotypes, and then bringing all that back to Barbie-land. This plot feels a bit disjointed. It ends up dragging the third act back to Barbie-land, when it feels all that belongs to stay in the first act. Everything with Barbie trying to make the other Barbies remember who they are, and revisiting ugly Barbie, should have been cut. It feels like a whole extra movie tacked onto a movie that already has plenty going on.All in all, it is a bit of a mess storywise. This script could have used a bit more editing. Also, it ends on a joke about Barbie looking forward to her first visit to a gynaecologist, which is a bit of low hanging fruit. When you try so hard to make a movie that has something to say about gender rolls, this is probably not the line should end on. Suddenly the story about a deleted elaborate farting scene makes a lot more sense.As a comedy movie, you can't aim for a high bar story wise, when your movie's comedy is aiming for the lowest bar.

Barbie is everything & bring on Kenergy,"I don't think I've been this excited about a movie in a long while.It was somewhat different than what I was expecting, but in some fantastic ways. Margot Robbie was a fantastic choice as Barbie. She shines, she makes you fall in LOVE with Barbie again, effervescent in every moment, she fully enveloped how a lot of us remember playing with Barbie, and what we thought and hoped for when we grew up.America Ferrera - fantastic.

A mix of somewhat funny summer-movie and social commentary. But it's all over the place.,"A commercial stretched into a full-length feature film.Barbieland, as an inversion of the real world with which it s mentally connected had a lot of potential. However, Barbie (both the doll and the film) is primarily a corporate product, and it's evident that the creators were not given freedom to explore the material in a more sophisticated way.The film explores several social issues (feminism, patriarchy, sexism, ...) in a way that may seem too preachy, in-your-face or even off-putting. I'd say that these topics are intentionally depicted with a child-like mindset and it may take a while to wrap our adult heads around such approach.Despite this, thanks to the vibrant cinematography, over-the-top social commentary, skillful direction, and great performances (Gosling as Ken rules), Barbie manages to entertain, albeit in a somewhat absurd way.Nevertheless, I expected more from it.",a mix somewhat funni summermovi social commentari but place,a commerci stretch fulllength featur filmbarbieland invers real world mental connect lot potenti howev barbi doll film primarili corpor product evid creator given freedom explor materi sophist wayth film explor sever social issu femin patriarchi sexism way may seem preachi inyourfac even offput id say topic intent depict childlik mindset may take wrap adult head around approachdespit thank vibrant cinematographi overthetop social commentari skill direct great perform gosl ken rule barbi manag entertain albeit somewhat absurd waynevertheless i expect
Thought it would be cheesy,"But was pleasantly surprised. I found it very emotional. Fabulous casting, dancing and soundtrack. My daughters 6 and 8 also loved it. My husband even went along and got a few laughs but ended up at the pub with my youngest because the cinema in general was too loud for her. I can see how it could upset and make people uncomfortable that are after a comedy seen through the eyes of a stereotypical comedy director, but that is what makes this movie so different. Definitely bring some tissues if you have any sort of mother-daughter relationship, both good, bad and in-between.

What Walt's Watching,"""Barbie"" the movie must be a dream come true for girls all over the world and some guys too if that's your jam.I know my daughter treasured her Barbie collection into adulthood and thought this was in her own words the ""Best Movie Ever""!The film opens with a brilliant parody to Stanley Kubrick's Sci-Fi Epic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968).Margot Robbie stars as ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and believe me she ain't the only Barbie in this Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy with very adult themes
You will laugh out loud at the clever script from Director Greta Gerwig and co-writer Noah Baumbach.Clearly they have done their research with every Barbie ever made and even some discontinued ones making an appearance, and of course all the accessories sold separately.The only one missing is ""Trixie Mattel"", based on the Drag Queen of the same name.America Ferrera shines like a diamond as ""Gloria"", one of the real humans who makes the journey to mythical Barbie Land after Barbie has an existential crisis and thinks about death.As a grown, smart, sophisticated woman she delivers one of the best soliloquy's ever in a movie.Will Ferrell on the hand as the ""Mattel CEO"" didn't meet the brief.I think the role required someone more grounded who you could believe as they make the transition of discovery to this Fantasy Land where only Barbies, Kens and one Allan exist.While Ryan Gosling is the key ""Ken"" based on Sun Lovin' Malibu Ken (1979), Simu Liu (""Kim's Convenience"", ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"") is one of the many other Ken's that populate this imaginary place of ""Kendom"" where their one and only job is to ""Beach"", but don't mistake them for lifesavers.Rhea Perlman (""Cheers"") has only 2 scenes as someone pivotal in the success of Barbies since 1959.Watch out for: ""Weird Barbie"" (other Barbies call her that behind her back and to her face) suitably played by Kate McKinnon and Michael Cera as ""Allan"". He really does fit into Ken's clothes.Plus the Pink Barbie Corvette and Caravan are stuff you'll want to take home with you.What I loved: The plethora of Barbies (including the deleted ones) and all the various Kens (don't forget John Cena as Merman Ken)
Listen for: Dame Helen Mirren's hilarious narration that breaks the fourth wall.The Production Design is so elaborate that you'll want to explore ""Barbie Land"" in more detail using the pause button when this Big Screen flick moves to BluRay and Streaming.The movie features a contemporary soundtrack that includes a nod to Aqua's ""Barbie Girl"".Unfortunately the Third Act lets down the movie.On the way to its denouement ""Barbie"" turns into ""Barbie the Musical""with more singing and dancing than ""La La Land"" in the ""Beach Off"".""Barbie"" she's everything.

"A funny film but with a spoon fed, preachy message and no real writing behind it","Barbie was a very funny and cute movie, however, the movie had more fluff than substance. The plot of this movie to me seems like it was created by writing ""lego movie"" and ""barbie goes to the real world"" on a piece of paper and then just winging it from there. The movie did not flow very well and the plot line seemed almost secondary to the message that the movie was trying to preach. I say preach because the movie never actually showed any conflicts for women except for maybe one or two quick shots. Instead we got a monologue from America Ferrera's character telling us the problems but never showing us any. For this reason I feel it was hard to build a connection with Barbie especially in the final act when the movie took a turn to try and be more deep than funny goofy like it had been the whole movie. There was also not very good resolution for a lot of characters. The Kens never truly got a resolution, like the writers couldn't come up with a good solution. Will Farrels character seemed almost forgotten about by the half way mark of the movie. Overall it was a very funny movie, but not a very solid one. The message felt like it was preached rather than shown, the ending felt forced down the throat rather than conclusive. Also there was a ridiculous 5 minute car ad for chevrolet that made me feel like I was watching a super bowl half time commercial.",a funni film spoon fed preachi messag real write behind,barbi funni cute movi howev movi fluff substanc the plot movi seem like creat write lego movi barbi goe real world piec paper wing the movi flow well plot line seem almost secondari messag movi tri preach i say preach movi never actual show conflict woman except mayb one two quick shot instead got monologu america ferrera charact tell u problem never show u for reason i feel hard build connect barbi especi final act movi took turn tri deep funni goofi like whole movi there also good resolut lot charact the ken never truli got resolut like writer couldnt come good solut will farrel charact seem almost forgotten half way mark movi overal funni movi solid one the messag felt like preach rather shown end felt forc throat rather conclus also ridicul minut car ad chevrolet made feel like i watch super bowl half time commerci
In Awe,"I love Greta Gerwig so I knew I'd love this. It, however, exceeded my expectations and was a movie so great it broke through my expectations and my version of the real world. I will see this again as many times and with as many people or by myself that I can. This is one of the greatest films not only of the year, but of the decade, if not the century. If I sound like I'm over exaggerating it, for me, I am completely serious. Please go watch it with your mom, your dad, your lover, your sister, your brother, your best friend, or your worst enemy.

Barbie: Review,"Good movie not a great one.My hopes for this movie were not all that high and the little light of hope for me was the fact that Greta Gerwig would be in the directors chair but as I had suspected she was not given 100% control of the film. I guarantee that every single second of this film was signed off by Mattel and you can definitely tell in some spots where they were the final say.Overall the story is ok, the setup is absolutely horrendous but after that the story becomes better and more interesting. The theme of feminism is very obviously woven throughout and does a decent job of bringing some of the issues the women face to life.The greatest achievement is the production and costume design as Barbieland is a very immersive experience but where it falls short are the scenes in the real world which just don't compare.The acting was all around good and had a couple of standouts including Ryan Gosling and America Ferrera. The big surprise was honestly Margot Robbie's performance which was far from the best in the film. Not to say Margot was bad just surprising considering she is the lead.Overall Barbie is good and will definitely get some nods for production and costume design during award season. Greta Gerwig was already a rising star in Hollywood but after taking on a film of this magnitude her phone will be ringing off the hook.",barbi review,good movi great onemi hope movi high littl light hope fact greta gerwig would director chair i suspect given control film i guarante everi singl second film sign mattel definit tell spot final sayoveral stori ok setup absolut horrend stori becom better interest the theme femin obvious woven throughout decent job bring issu woman face lifeth greatest achiev product costum design barbieland immers experi fall short scene real world dont compareth act around good coupl standout includ ryan gosl america ferrera the big surpris honestli margot robbi perform far best film not say margot bad surpris consid leadoveral barbi good definit get nod product costum design award season greta gerwig alreadi rise star hollywood take film magnitud phone ring hook
Lack of Depth,"Let's start with what I enjoyed. The scenery, costumes and music were very nice but I believe that this movie was way over-hyped. I expected Barbie to be a touching movie that showed the positive and negative effects of this doll on society with a few FUNNY jokes here and there. Instead, I was greeted with an overly dramatic, some would say cringey, movie that sounds badly written. It seems that this movie doesn't fit in any category. It is definitely not a drama, nor a comedy as all the jokes were laughable, but for the wrong reason. The moral of the story is one that can definitely be appreciated, but just isn't suited for this type of movie. A pink doll travelling between the Barbie world and the real world wasn't enough to convey a strong message on the stringent beauty standards that hurt this generation of women. If you are not into Barbie, this movie is definitely not for you.",lack depth,let start i enjoy the sceneri costum music nice i believ movi way overhyp i expect barbi touch movi show posit neg effect doll societi funni joke instead i greet overli dramat would say cringey movi sound badli written it seem movi doesnt fit categori it definit drama comedi joke laughabl wrong reason the moral stori one definit appreci isnt suit type movi a pink doll travel barbi world real world wasnt enough convey strong messag stringent beauti standard hurt gener woman if barbi movi definit
Laughed tears and that's Kenough,"I saw the trailer and knew it would be a pretty fun movie to watch. It was so over the top with just everything (colours, world of women, world of men, horses and lectures) that in the end, all what matters was I laughed tears watching it. And so did everybody in the cinema I went to. The beach fight, Ken's obsession with horses and Will Ferrell on rollerblades.. it can't get better than that. The only issue for me was the end, when Barbie decides to go to the real world. That scene was a bit long.If you like sarcasm, satire and Will Ferrell, go and watch!

It's alright,"I have seen this film in theaters twice now and I can safely say that I thought it was amusing, entertaining, and fun. However, I won't lie to you and say that it's really all that groundbreaking as some seem to claim. While this movie focuses on heavy topics such as inequality and feminism, some of the scenes that had primarily concentrated on them had felt a little shallow. I am not saying that this wasn't a great film, as said before, it delivered most if not all of the checkpoints that modern day society defines a ""good movie"" with. Now I can't say that I wasn't entertained mostly through the movie but it just lacked something. The longer this film had stuck with me the longer it felt insufficient. People that are currently speaking on this movie seem to pin up its success in presenting femininity and women's issues in a lighthearted and joyful manner, however I feel that the overall message in this movie could have been provided in a more severe tone. The creators of Barbie stated that this was an ""everyone movie"", that this film was designed to cater to all viewers, but did it have to? The laughable tone this movie brought along with its own narrative of modern day feminism sort of cheapened the message. Don't get me wrong, all the acting in the movie was phenomenal for the roles each actor portrayed, but it felt like some of the plot had gotten lost in translation. Even after watching the movie twice I still am a little fuzzy on the entirety of ""Barbieland"". Where is this really set?, why it is a common occurrence of dolls making their way into the real world?, why do barbies know they're toys? I might just be inattentive but these plot point were rarely touched on through the film and still leave me confused. Overall I think my main issue with this film is my regrettable rating, I really didn't want this movie to be below a 9. I was really looking forward to this film and eagerly waiting to ""do anything to see it in theaters again"", but it turned out to be just ok. A word I can describe my expectations for this movie is iconic, but it just fell flat in that department. Would I recommend? Yeah why not, but would I jump at the opportunity to see it again ever? Probably not.",it alright,i seen film theater twice i safe say i thought amus entertain fun howev i wont lie say realli groundbreak seem claim while movi focus heavi topic inequ femin scene primarili concentr felt littl shallow i say wasnt great film said deliv checkpoint modern day societi defin good movi now i cant say i wasnt entertain mostli movi lack someth the longer film stuck longer felt insuffici peopl current speak movi seem pin success present feminin woman issu lightheart joy manner howev i feel overal messag movi could provid sever tone the creator barbi state everyon movi film design cater viewer the laughabl tone movi brought along narr modern day femin sort cheapen messag dont get wrong act movi phenomen role actor portray felt like plot gotten lost translat even watch movi twice i still littl fuzzi entireti barbieland where realli set common occurr doll make way real world barbi know theyr toy i might inattent plot point rare touch film still leav confus overal i think main issu film regrett rate i realli didnt want movi i realli look forward film eagerli wait anyth see theater turn ok a word i describ expect movi icon fell flat depart would i recommend yeah would i jump opportun see ever probabl
Really good . Like nothing I've seen before,"I thought all the jokes were really funny and I felt a bit sorry for Ken while all the barbies rule barbie world all ken (Ryan gosling) wants is to be noticed by barbie (Margot Robbie) and when he goes to the real world and discovers that it's all about men and horses and he freaks out . I also loved the fact that all the barbies were not all skinny and blonde . I also thought that it was really sweet the way barbie met Ruth and Ruth was kind off like a mother to her and she helped her along the way in the movie . Everything was pink I can see how there was a shortage of pink paint . And it was really funny when the narrator was giving her opinion throughout the movie .

I don't know how to describe,The movie was weirdly quick at the beginning and weirdly long at the end. The beginning of the film felt like a glorified way to show off Margot Robbie's feet. The movie it self was quite meta at times and even made me laugh but I felt like it had too much hype. Also was the movie about sexism or getting older and was Will Ferril the villain or was Ken. There were just somethings that didn't need to be in this. Greta Gerwig is a great director Wonder Woman proves that it's just this movie could have been different. I Manley started re-enjoying the movie was when the kens had their battle. Sorry if I have wasted your time but that's my opinion.,i dont know describ,the movi weirdli quick begin weirdli long end the begin film felt like glorifi way show margot robbi foot the movi self quit meta time even made laugh i felt like much hype also movi sexism get older will ferril villain ken there someth didnt need greta gerwig great director wonder woman prove movi could differ i manley start reenjoy movi ken battl sorri i wast time that opinion
One of the Best Comedies of the Year,"I went to see Barbie in theaters today, and it is one of the best comedies of this year.The story is really good, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling did awesome as Barbie and Ken, respectively, the production design is amazing, Greta Gerwig's direction was pretty good, and the soundtrack was great. Billie Eilish's song ""What Was I Made For"" was also so good.Barbie is one of the best movies of 2023, and my fifth favorite movie of 2023 so far. I recommend going to see it in theaters.

Entertaining Fluff - Barbie,"My teenage son, Joseph, dragged me to this film, as I wanted to see Oppenheimer, instead. However, i was not disappointed in the film, and especially by the performance of Margot Robbie, who had already made a big splash with her quirky and entertaining Suicide Squad role. Ryan Gosling is fine as Ken, but I thought that another actor might have been a more appropriate choice, as Gosling is a fine dramatic actor, but is not really noted for satire or comedy.The director refrains from making the film too preachy for the majority of the movie, but sometimes lets the film bog down a bit during the transitions of Barbie Land throughout the film. None of the secondary characters were really too memorable. Other than that, the film is entertaining, and a pleasant way to spend a rainy afternoon at the movies.",entertain fluff barbi,my teenag son joseph drag film i want see oppenheim instead howev disappoint film especi perform margot robbi alreadi made big splash quirki entertain suicid squad role ryan gosl fine ken i thought anoth actor might appropri choic gosl fine dramat actor realli note satir comedyth director refrain make film preachi major movi sometim let film bog bit transit barbi land throughout film none secondari charact realli memor other film entertain pleasant way spend raini afternoon movi
Solid but a bit overhyped,"This movie is not completely worthless like I was expecting it to be when I saw the trailer. There are some good comedic bits in this movie, and the acting is fairly good. There is also a lot more substance to this film than I was expecting, this movie really is geared towards adults rather than kids.I appreciate the movie touching on some interesting topics. Like the impact that Barbie has had on body image, her impact on gender roles, and the unhealthy obsession with material items. It is certainly a bold move by the director, one that could have been executed better. At times the delivery of the messaging feels too clunky, including a Shakespearean monologue from America Ferrera. This is also a movie that doesn't seem to want to end. The final 15 minutes drag with an inefficient wrap up sequence.",solid bit overhyp,thi movi complet worthless like i expect i saw trailer there good comed bit movi act fairli good there also lot substanc film i expect movi realli gear toward adult rather kidsi appreci movi touch interest topic like impact barbi bodi imag impact gender role unhealthi ob materi item it certainli bold move director one could execut better at time deliveri messag feel clunki includ shakespearean monologu america ferrera thi also movi doesnt seem want end the final minut drag ineffici wrap sequenc
Absolutely powerful movie and changed my perspective on life,"This movie is not for people who cry a lot. It was a beautiful movie with proper cinematic gold.Starting with Barbie land, it showed the complete difference between a patriarcy and a matriarcy. While the Barbies are in control there Is a lack of violence between the Kens and the Barbies. The most toxic thing is a jealousy broken between Ryan Goslings Ken and Simu Liu's Ken. Although, the Kens all work partially sexualising jobs like cheerleaders and stupid jobs like 'beach' which is a role reversal of the human world. Barbie's entire world focuses on a routine and when that routine is disrupted we see Barbie spiral out of control.Side note: the whole concept of weird Barbie's house is amazing, the discontinued Barbie's and Ken's are hilarious especially when you realise their backstories.Then the human world is depicted with both bad elements and good elements. Under this patriarchy we see both women and men being incredibly toxic and awful. Barbie gets continuously catcalled and even assaulted showing the harsh reality of what women like us actually go through. We also see Barbie experience true emotion seeing friends laughing together and an old woman on a bench which kinda made me cry a bit. This is when Ken partially learns about the patriarchy and starts to want more. The sequences in the human world aren't as interesting as Barbie world but still keep you hooked in.Then going back to Barbie world we see Ken's patriarchy. Unlike the Barbie's matriarchy it is completely toxic. The Barbies are all maids and 'stupid' only ever caring for the Kens. And then the Kens actually start a war with eachother over the Barbies. However the Kens are actually stupid and clearly don't see what they want. Ryan Gosling's Ken then explains to Barbie that he didn't like how he was treated before and he doesn't like the world he's built for himself now, and they settle on the opposite of the actual human world. The Barbies still run everything but they give the Kens more opportunities (the Kens ask for some supreme court positions and they get told they can have lower down positions). This is the opposite to the human world where the men have all the high up positions but at least women get to vote now.....Finally the ending where Barbie is taken away by Ruth is beautiful. This made me cry the most, watching all these things that makes us human and balling my eyes out. This movie is a masterpiece and deserves the Oscar this year more than any other.",absolut power movi chang perspect life,thi movi peopl cri lot it beauti movi proper cinemat goldstart barbi land show complet differ patriarci matriarci while barbi control is lack violenc ken barbi the toxic thing jealousi broken ryan gosl ken simu liu ken although ken work partial sexualis job like cheerlead stupid job like beach role revers human world barbi entir world focus routin routin disrupt see barbi spiral controlsid note whole concept weird barbi hous amaz discontinu barbi ken hilari especi realis backstoriesthen human world depict bad element good element under patriarchi see woman men incred toxic aw barbi get continu catcal even assault show harsh realiti woman like u actual go we also see barbi experi true emot see friend laugh togeth old woman bench kinda made cri bit thi ken partial learn patriarchi start want the sequenc human world arent interest barbi world still keep hook inthen go back barbi world see ken patriarchi unlik barbi matriarchi complet toxic the barbi maid stupid ever care ken and ken actual start war eachoth barbi howev ken actual stupid clearli dont see want ryan gosl ken explain barbi didnt like treat doesnt like world he built settl opposit actual human world the barbi still run everyth give ken opportun ken ask suprem court posit get told lower posit thi opposit human world men high posit least woman get vote nowfin end barbi taken away ruth beauti thi made cri watch thing make u human ball eye thi movi masterpiec deserv oscar year
Had no right to be as good as it was,"I remember when a 'Barbie' movie was announced thinking to myself what a disaster that is going to be. So I was pretty surprised when the film finally came out and the feedback was glowingly positive for the most part. I don't think the film was as good as some people have made it out to be, but it was certainly a lot better than the concept had any right to be.The film is at its best when it is trying to be light-hearted and funny. There are some genuinely funny and clever jokes in this film. Simple stuff most of the time, but done in a way that actually made me laugh out loud. If the movie had kept this tone for the entire run time it could've been a true classic.But in the second half of the movie things change. It decides it needs to make a point and the movie gets weighed down and loses steam as it tries to do this, ultimately limping to the finish line.At it's best this film is very good.

"Dawn, that flic was hollow","I was very surprise as the film turned out to be a very hollow matter. Why did they stretch the ""Hello Barbie""-""Hello Barbie"" joke all over the movie. Running gag? This film was so boring, the jokes so unadventurous, the characters so flat. The film was the look and feel of a 20 minute-TV-show stretched to infinity. Ryan Gosling was cool, but in the wrong movie. Margot Robbie is beautiful. That's it. She squeezed exactly one characteristic out of the puppet.

Beautiful,"This movie made me laugh, and cry. It was a beautiful commentary on sexism and the patriarchy and how it affects little girls, while still poking fun at it all. It also spreads a really inspiring message about mothers. I personally wouldn't show this movie to a child TOO young as there are a few jokes about how barbie's don't have genitals, one bleeped f word, and a few mentions of beer. It was a LITTLE depressing, but overall very inspirational. Despite, of course, the discussion of misogyny, I laughed through the whole thing. It was hilarious. It addressed also how adult women/mothers feel self conscious about not being perfect. It was beautiful and I'd watch again.",beauti,thi movi made laugh cri it beauti commentari sexism patriarchi affect littl girl still poke fun it also spread realli inspir messag mother i person wouldnt show movi child too young joke barbi dont genit one bleep f word mention beer it littl depress overal inspir despit cours discus misogyni i laugh whole thing it hilari it address also adult womenmoth feel self consciou perfect it beauti id watch
"It swings, and it kinda hits. Kinda.","BARBIEHEIMER is among us! Between BARBIE and OPPENHEIMER releasing on the same week, the wife really wanted to see this first and I obliged.BARBIE is definitely bound to have some divisiveness due to its ""feminism"" - and yes a lot of feminism (honestly what did you expect). Not addressing this is like not addressing the nuclear bomb in OPPENHEIMER. For a movie about a children's toy, I got to give it some kudos for its subversion and tying to put out a message this big. I'm not shocked that the film focused a bit more on the reality elements of the real world as opposed to the fantasy side. A lot of that is because this is a Greta Gerwig film (co-written with her partner Noah Baumbach) and she is one of the best working director/writer today.The unconventional approach is something to admire. The film swings with these metaphysical ideas and existential crisis. The performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling carry the film. Robbie tackles the role very well. The story asks her to do a lot, and Robbie showcases Barbie's awakening with sincerity, terror, confusion, naivety, humor and bittersweet acceptance. Gosling gets to cut loose and be funny. He goes on his own journey to discovering who he is so there's layers to his Ken as well. He also has a funny rivalry/banter with Simu Liu's Ken.Rest of the supporting cast are a bit underdeveloped, but they get moments to shine here and there and serve the plot in motion. Some highlights are Kingsley Ben-Adir, Issa Rae, Michael Cera and Kate McKinnon.America Ferrara and Ariana Greenblatt are the human mother/daughter duo in the film. Ferrara's character delivers a monolog that is very on the nose and at that point you're with it or meh about it. For me personally, I honestly don't mind it as long as its entertaining, and to the film's credit it was, for at least the first act of the film. It's at its best with the self aware meta humor, but eventually the film gets too carried away and takes itself too seriously, loosing its humor and leaving us experiencing moments that are a bit of a chore to sit through.One could say it was refreshing to watch an incredibly self aware film that isn't afraid to be bold in its message, but for me, while I agree with the underlying message it's very heavy handed and preachy. I connected more when the film explored the nature of Barbie's character. There's one scene that tackles Barbie's legacy directly that raised the existential crisis for her, but it isn't revisited in favor of telling a bigger societal story.Production design, the sets and visuals are very well done. Shoutout to production designer Sarah Greenwood and set decorators Katie Spencer. I feel like Barbie could take home the Oscar for production design. When you're in Barbie Land, the overall usage of pink and the plastic feel makes the whole experience feel immersive. Cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto makes the film feel like you're there. It has a vibrant and inviting energy that you can't help but gaze at.I am curious how some families who saw the film feel about it as some might have expected a more straight forward approach, as opposed to this more nuanced subversive take, but I think overall the film is destined to be enjoyed overall and successful. It just might get a sequel if it can rake in the money, which it looks like it will.As a male, this film isn't made for me. I'm obviously not the target audience for it. However, the film did enough to make me feel engaged where I laughed at some jokes, but the second half is where I felt the film was talking at me instead of engaging me as a viewer. It flirts with being a unique fantasy/real world introspective story, but then seems to be more interested in making a point by the end of it.6/10.",it swing kinda hit kinda,barbieheim among u between barbi oppenheim releas week wife realli want see first i obligedbarbi definit bound divis due femin ye lot femin honestli expect not address like address nuclear bomb oppenheim for movi child toy i got give kudo subvers tie put messag big im shock film focus bit realiti element real world oppos fantasi side a lot greta gerwig film cowritten partner noah baumbach one best work directorwrit todayth unconvent approach someth admir the film swing metaphys idea existenti crisi the perform margot robbi ryan gosl carri film robbi tackl role well the stori ask lot robbi showcas barbi awaken sincer terror confus naiveti humor bittersweet accept gosl get cut loo funni he goe journey discov there layer ken well he also funni rivalrybant simu liu kenrest support cast bit underdevelop get moment shine serv plot motion some highlight kingsley benadir issa rae michael cera kate mckinnonamerica ferrara ariana greenblatt human motherdaught duo film ferrara charact deliv monolog nose point your meh for person i honestli dont mind long entertain film credit least first act film it best self awar meta humor eventu film get carri away take serious loo humor leav u experienc moment bit chore sit throughon could say refresh watch incred self awar film isnt afraid bold messag i agre underli messag heavi hand preachi i connect film explor natur barbi charact there one scene tackl barbi legaci directli rais existenti crisi isnt revisit favor tell bigger societ storyproduct design set visual well done shoutout product design sarah greenwood set decor kati spencer i feel like barbi could take home oscar product design when your barbi land overal usag pink plastic feel make whole experi feel immers cinematographi rodrigo prieto make film feel like your it vibrant invit energi cant help gaze ati curiou famili saw film feel might expect straight forward approach oppos nuanc subvers take i think overal film destin enjoy overal success it might get sequel rake money look like willa male film isnt made im obvious target audienc howev film enough make feel engag i laugh joke second half i felt film talk instead engag viewer it flirt uniqu fantasyr world introspect stori seem interest make point end
You Ken Do It!,"Funny this was teamed with Oppenheimer because this was anything but a bomb.I missed this that rocking opening weekend that was one of the biggest, non-sequel, event weekends in at least half-a-decade. I miss these premiere weekends for cinema, and not the MCU/Conjuring/type expected blowouts. And I'm sorry I missed this one.I laughed almost from minute one to the end. This was one enormously hilarious and yet, thought-provoking, inventive fantasy-comedies suited for all ages. And I'm super glad Barbie really turned on itself.Okay, more like evolved to get with the times. I do appreciate they addressed the elephant in the room concerning how unrealistic the brand Barbie is. This would've equally worked as a straight-up parody and I am happy Mattel was able to be both in on the joke and flat out address it. I remember thinking the same thing when I saw ""Hidden Figures"": EVERY YOUNG FEMALE needs to see this movie. (Yes, boys too, but for those girls still being taught Barbie is Right, they need to see this.)She's a Barbie Girl in her Barbie World, with many more Barbies, a few Kens and one unsuccessful escape artist, Michael Cera. When our main Barbie suddenly gets her own emotion chip, she must travel to the real world to make everything go back to being perfect. But is that really her, or Ken's fate?I wish I knew more of the background of the Barbie empire. Though, honestly, they really broke the fourth wall and spelt out a lot of the Easter Eggs which was nice. I'm still sure they included/mocked a ton of her real history.This make-believe, almost completely void of realism movie was a real joy to watch. Some of the jokes had me rolling, the set-pieces and characters were all so much fun - not an unlikable character in the film and music/set designs alone should win Oscars. Not to mention the cast.I have YET to see a bad Margot Robbie performance. How has she not won Oscars herself? She 100% commits to every role and gives her heart out, even in some of her bad movies. I'm not a fan of Ryan Gosling, so it was refreshing to see him step out of his normal roles and see more of his character than just the brand ""Ryan Gosling."" And the supporting cast was just as great including the hilarious Will Ferrell who steals every scene, especially when he's a second or third tier part and the always gorgeous Simu Liu who always looks so happy to be in any role he's in. He's always been a pretty boy/not-so-great actor, but I never, ever mind seeing him in anything.This would definitely be a huge recommendation to anyone, but I know you all have already seen it. And good for you/bad for me for waiting this long. I thought I could make it to streaming...glad I took the leap. Besides I found this locally owned movie theatre with a ""private screening room,"" like for Movie Execs to experience their end-project and is now my all-time favorite movie theatre. (Roadhouse Cinemas in Scottsdale, AZ. 10/10 star place for sure.)Very pleased I saw this and would love to do more research now with an Every-Easter-Egg vlog. And YEEEES, they played my song. Well, an updated version and I think it called for that.(Disclaimer, I flipflopped back/forth in-between 8 and 9 stars. But, as I recalled more hilarious jokes, like my personal favorite Beach-Off scene, this is a solid 9 stars out of 10. I can't wait to see this again as there were many, many comedic and inventive humor scenes I may have missed due to my laughing.)***Final Thoughts: Growing up and moving around a ton in my youth, my whole world was my sister. I sometimes had friends, but mostly her girl-friends were my friends by default. I do recall playing with Barbies with them, always having/wanting to be Ken. (I wasn't a fan; I was just going with the flow.) Funny, thinking about it now, I did exactly what this movie broadcasted in the opening: I treated Ken like he was just Barbie's. I would use Ken just to ask Barbie for a cup of sugar or something stupid while trying to fit in. C'mon Ken, you're more than just a cup of sugar.Well, except Simu Liu, he's a whole lotta Sugar.",you ken do it,funni team oppenheim anyth bombi miss rock open weekend one biggest nonsequel event weekend least halfadecad i miss premier weekend cinema mcuconjuringtyp expect blowout and im sorri i miss onei laugh almost minut one end thi one enorm hilari yet thoughtprovok invent fantasycomedi suit age and im super glad barbi realli turn itselfokay like evolv get time i appreci address eleph room concern unrealist brand barbi thi wouldv equal work straightup parodi i happi mattel abl joke flat address i rememb think thing i saw hidden figur everi young femal need see movi ye boy girl still taught barbi right need see thissh barbi girl barbi world mani barbi ken one unsuccess escap artist michael cera when main barbi suddenli get emot chip must travel real world make everyth go back perfect but realli ken fatei wish i knew background barbi empir though honestli realli broke fourth wall spelt lot easter egg nice im still sure includedmock ton real historythi makebeliev almost complet void realism movi real joy watch some joke roll setpiec charact much fun unlik charact film musicset design alon win oscar not mention casti yet see bad margot robbi perform how oscar she commit everi role give heart even bad movi im fan ryan gosl refresh see step normal role see charact brand ryan gosl and support cast great includ hilari will ferrel steal everi scene especi he second third tier part alway gorgeou simu liu alway look happi role he he alway pretti boynotsogreat actor i never ever mind see anythingthi would definit huge recommend anyon i know alreadi seen and good youbad wait long i thought i could make streamingglad i took leap besid i found local own movi theatr privat screen room like movi exec experi endproject alltim favorit movi theatr roadhous cinema scottsdal az star place sureveri plea i saw would love research everyeasteregg vlog and yeeee play song well updat version i think call thatdisclaim i flipflop backforth inbetween star but i recal hilari joke like person favorit beachoff scene solid star i cant wait see mani mani comed invent humor scene i may miss due laughingfin thought grow move around ton youth whole world sister i sometim friend mostli girlfriend friend default i recal play barbi alway havingw ken i wasnt fan i go flow funni think i exactli movi broadcast open i treat ken like barbi i would use ken ask barbi cup sugar someth stupid tri fit cmon ken your cup sugarwel except simu liu he whole lotta sugar
Ok,"Not great but better than this humble writer or anyone tend to expect. I mean the art direction is fun and definitely the most best part IM0. There are fun and clever moments throughout the creative story. Ultimately the performances are well articulated regardless of odd story beats. The place where this film falls apart is the 3rd act. The film becomes innately ""preachy"". Im all for equality and female empowerment and all the things this story bequeaths to the audience. Just becomes a little over sanctimonious for my personal liking. The direction is great and despite my personal criticisms/nitpicks the quality here is still very palpable.",ok,not great better humbl writer anyon tend expect i mean art direct fun definit best part im there fun clever moment throughout creativ stori ultim perform well articul regardless odd stori beat the place film fall apart rd act the film becom innat preachi im equal femal empower thing stori bequeath audienc just becom littl sanctimoni person like the direct great despit person criticismsnitpick qualiti still palpabl
Unexpectedly good!,"I was be able to attend the pre premiere of this movie and I have to say this movie was unexpectetly good and this comes from a non Barbie fan. Barbie is the role Robbie was clearly born to play. Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu were incredible too and actually the whole cast of this movie shines ! Barbie is a brilliantly executed, incredibly fun, brightly colored, completely logical feminist statement that should be remembered come awards season. Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic.

Divided,"I saw this movie a month ago and I've had a hard time gathering my thoughts for a review. I think that I need to give it another watch. That being said, my reaction from my first viewing is mixed.On one side, there are so many positives about this film. The casting is spot-on, with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling perfectly fitting their characters. The visuals in Barbie World are vibrant and exciting. The humor is excellent and made me genuinely laugh out loud. Not to mention the brilliance of Allan.On the other side, the film has an agenda and they push it hard. The message of female empowerment is strong, but at times it crossed over into preachy territory. My theater hardly laughed and the entire row in front of me walked out about 3/4 through. While I loved the moments in Barbie World, I did not enjoy the scenes in the real world or anything with Will Ferrell.At its core, this movie is a powerful reminder of what life is like for a woman (i.e., America Ferrera's monologue) and a call to action for me. Unfortunately, the in-your-face approach might alienate some rather than inspire.Best Character: Ken (Though Allan was brilliant)

Playful idea about the Barbie concept that gets lost in the messy story.,"Barbie is a new fantasy comedy directed, part written and produced by Greta Gerwig, director of Lady Bird and Little Women.In Barbieland, everything is perfect and everything runs smoothly. Yet Barbie (Margot Robbie) learns that something is not right and everything suddenly seems less than perfect for her. Because of this, she decides to travel to the real world, to find out what's going on.On this journey she is accompanied by Ken (Ryan Gosling), who secretly tried to go with her. Together they now try to figure out what's going on, but learn that the real world is very different compared to Barbieland.Greta Gerwig, together with the photography director Rodrigo Prieto, knows how to convey the Barbie world well, making it seem as if you are in a life-sized doll's room as a viewer. They used beautiful film sets for this. Thus, the film works well as long as it is set in the Barbieland. Only that everyone here is Barbie or Ken sometimes makes it a bit difficult to follow the exact differences between all Barbies and Kens.When the story moves to the real world, it changes the movie a bit. For example, how exactly it is possible to travel between the two worlds is not really clearly explained. Furthermore, the movie loses credibility when Barbie and Ken can do anything in the real world with no real consequences. Due to the lack of explanation and an eye for detail, the film can sometimes come across as a bit strange.In a comical way, they also try to make fun of both gender roles. For example, Barbieland should represent the opposite of the real world. In Barbieland, Barbies and Kens can do anything, but Barbie is often above Ken. In the real world, men often seem to be above women. For example, they try to divide this role in the opposite way. For male viewers, who do not like these current feminism movements, this can make this film less.Despite multiple actors and actresses playing different Barbies and Kens, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling manage to portray their roles in more unique ways alongside the other Barbies and Kens cast members. Margot Robbie comes across as a real Barbie, trying to discover what her life destinies really are. Ryan Gosling manages to provide plenty of appropriate comedic moments as Ken, who tries to make Barbie notice him. In the real world, however, he learns that as Ken, he can also do other things without Barbie. Will Ferrell plays the CEO of Mattel, the toy company that makes the barbie doll. His character and the other employees are supposed to be in the real world, but they seem more like they're also in a cartoon world because of the ways they act. This makes the concept of the real world seem a bit unusual. If they brought out the real world a little better, the movie could have been a little better.The Barbie and Ken concept is better brought to the fore in Toy Story 3, for example, where these dolls and the idea they stand for are also handled a bit playfully.",play idea barbi concept get lost messi stori,barbi new fantasi comedi direct part written produc greta gerwig director ladi bird littl womenin barbieland everyth perfect everyth run smoothli yet barbi margot robbi learn someth right everyth suddenli seem le perfect becaus decid travel real world find what go onon journey accompani ken ryan gosl secretli tri go togeth tri figur what go learn real world differ compar barbielandgreta gerwig togeth photographi director rodrigo prieto know convey barbi world well make seem life doll room viewer they use beauti film set thu film work well long set barbieland onli everyon barbi ken sometim make bit difficult follow exact differ barbi kenswhen stori move real world chang movi bit for exampl exactli possibl travel two world realli clearli explain furthermor movi lose credibl barbi ken anyth real world real consequ due lack explan eye detail film sometim come across bit strangein comic way also tri make fun gender role for exampl barbieland repres opposit real world in barbieland barbi ken anyth barbi often ken in real world men often seem woman for exampl tri divid role opposit way for male viewer like current femin movement make film lessdespit multipl actor actress play differ barbi ken margot robbi ryan gosl manag portray role uniqu way alongsid barbi ken cast member margot robbi come across real barbi tri discov life destini realli ryan gosl manag provid plenti appropri comed moment ken tri make barbi notic in real world howev learn ken also thing without barbi will ferrel play ceo mattel toy compani make barbi doll hi charact employe suppos real world seem like theyr also cartoon world way act thi make concept real world seem bit unusu if brought real world littl better movi could littl betterth barbi ken concept better brought fore toy stori exampl doll idea stand also handl bit play
Love it 😍,"The beauty in the movie isn't merely skin deep. The story woven throughout Barbie is a true testament to the power of belief in oneself and the importance of friendship and teamwork. Barbie's determination and courage in the face of challenges inspire viewers to embrace their own strengths and strive for greatness. The characters in Barbie are wonderfully developed, each with their own unique personalities that add depth and charm to the narrative. Barbie herself, with her resilience and strong sense of justice, is a shining example of a positive role model.Her friends are equally engaging, showcasing the power of unity and support.Beyond the captivating story, Barbie also crafts an empowering message about inner beauty and acceptance. It teaches viewers that true beauty lies within, emphasizing the importance of self-acceptance and celebrating our individuality.",love,the beauti movi isnt mere skin deep the stori woven throughout barbi true testament power belief oneself import friendship teamwork barbi determin courag face challeng inspir viewer embrac strength strive great the charact barbi wonder develop uniqu person add depth charm narr barbi resili strong sen justic shine exampl posit role modelh friend equal engag showcas power uniti supportbeyond captiv stori barbi also craft empow messag inner beauti accept it teach viewer true beauti lie within emphas import selfaccept celebr individu
Somewhere there is a good story,"For starters this movie was made by women for women. I was not the intended audience, which is fine. But I feel like there is a good story somewhere hidden here, or there could have been one. That everyone could have really liked.The movie is well made; I could tell that the people who made the movie liked Barbie, and knew their stuff. And that bleed into the movie. It has a cool set, lot's of creative choices and has good actors. With some genuinely funny gags and jokes.The cons: Some movies are great pieces of art, where you can't nail down what exactly the movie is about or trying to say. The classic disney movies like Beauty and the Beast, Peter Pan Pinocchio are good examples where they more about exploring ideas and themes.Then there some films like Atlas Shrugged where you know exactly what it's trying to say from the get-go. This is one of the those films, except it doesn't just focus on one message but three or four awkwardly placed one after another. This film felt like a first draft and could of used a couple rewrites to tighten it up.I don't think this film could ever decided what it wanted to be. And it tried to be too many things at once making it a little nonsensical. And all the main characters were brought together in a very inorganic way. There was even this car chase scene in middle which I believe they wrote in for strict purpose of doing a car commercial for Chevrolet.Also there were some very weird parts of the movie. Where the messaging was just wrong in so many ways. I'll just give one example and finish on that. At the end Barbie is sad because the patriarchy won but is roused when the mom did a rant about all the problems women have. But she is wrong, everything she listed weren't women problems they were people problems. That's life. I sorry but it's not the fact you are a women that you struggle with being either a respected boss or a liked boss. Go talk to Machiaveli. These are problems everyone has.Anyway that's my review. I hope it's balanced and fair and gave you a good idea about what this film is .",somewher good stori,for starter movi made woman woman i intend audienc fine but i feel like good stori somewher hidden could one that everyon could realli likedth movi well made i could tell peopl made movi like barbi knew stuff and bleed movi it cool set lot creativ choic good actor with genuin funni gag jokesth con some movi great piec art cant nail exactli movi tri say the classic disney movi like beauti beast peter pan pinocchio good exampl explor idea themesthen film like atla shrug know exactli tri say getgo thi one film except doesnt focu one messag three four awkwardli place one anoth thi film felt like first draft could use coupl rewrit tighten upi dont think film could ever decid want and tri mani thing make littl nonsens and main charact brought togeth inorgan way there even car chase scene middl i believ wrote strict purpos car commerci chevroletalso weird part movi where messag wrong mani way ill give one exampl finish at end barbi sad patriarchi rous mom rant problem woman but wrong everyth list werent woman problem peopl problem that life i sorri fact woman struggl either respect bos like bos go talk machiav these problem everyon hasanyway that review i hope balanc fair gave good idea film
Misleading,"This movie was supposed to be fun light hearted watch but turns into an obnoxious headache filled with political message on and on and on.The only Relief is honestly Ryan Gosling's Ken who made me crack up multiple times, and he lives as Ken to be honest; there is no Ryan Gosling anymore it's just Ken and he was the protagonist for me.They really show men as cowardly, stupid, needy, power hungry and so on and on. When they showed the real world they could have shown the good and bads parts of it but only the so called patriarchy was shown; like come on. As if it's not already clear for us as audience that all men are horrible and mistreats women we are treated with many monologues of feminism. You would at least think they would go for true equal rights(the thing which actual feminists used to fight for) at the very end but Nooo!

Full of Surprises,"This movie, wow. Just wow. This was unlike anything I had expected going in to seeing Barbie earlier today. I figured by the trailers alone it was going to be a fun popcorn movie filled with adventure and eventual romance between Barbie and Ken with it ending with them getting together, beating bad guys when crossing into our world and living happily ever afterBoy was I wrong. Holy moly, Barbie hits deep and can be thought provoking, at least to me it was deep and thought provoking. I mean seriously, this isnt a typical fun popcorn movie. Yes it is still fun and pretty damn hilarious at times. But the themes it was showing throughout the story with it being the following - self identity, discovering who you are as a person and want to do in life. It is ok to be imperfect, to be weird, kooky, dark, it's ok to not live up to anyone's expectations in life or those around you. Just be you and only you. Self love. Willing to accept change even if you dont like it. There's also this indepth battle between patriarchy vs matriarchy with some feminism thrown into the mixIt's funny, heartwarming, filled with unexpected surprises and Im sure for all the hardcore Barbie fans who collect the dolls and merch it has all the easter eggs and classic accessible shown through this brilliant movieMargot Robbie and Ryan Gosling did an exceptional job as Barbie and Ken giving us pretty complex and deep characters with them both growing and developing over time.

Not for me,"With all the hype about this movie, I finally got around to watching it when it came out on Netflix. I am not sure why, but I just could not get into it. I thought the main actors were quite good, but I lost interest in the story line early on. I tried again, and same thing happened.I thought the casting was good, the acting was good, and the special effects worked well. I even thought the premise of the movie, the story line, was good. But I found myself getting bored over and again, despite multiple attempts.But I'm fairly certain I""m not the target demographic for this movie, which is perfectly fine.

A Barbie World?,"I am so torn, on this movie. There is no doubt, that Barbie is beautifully made movie, with an awesome cast and an amazing creative team.

But, I did not care for the writing and some of the movies messages, were not just bad, but problematic.

"The last act was such a redeemer. I love you, Greta! [+78%]","My only-ever memory of a Barbie doll was the one my cousin sister once owned, and I secretly sabotaged, owing to some temporary argument in our childhood. I do remember that it was a stereotypical version, with blonde hair and a pink (or some shade of it) dress. I made that once-good-looking doll into Crazy Barbie, by drawing weird shapes on her face, pulling some of her hair out, and twisting (at least) one of her plastic limbs. I also remember hiding away some of the crockery (tea cups and the like) shortly after. Well, this film brought back that repressed memory, which I don't think I apologized to her for. Of course I did so, afterwards, and that's how rewarding the movie felt for me.The first act of Barbie was deliberately ""plastic"", as if Gerwig was trying to reinforce the idea of how a perfectly feminine world exists. The ""Hi Barbie""s were starting to get a bit annoying, and the unabashed celebration of ""every night being girls night"", and women basically holding all decision-making power came across as Gerwing trying to impose the blunt idea that if women are involved in everything, the world automatically becomes a better place - no questions asked. When you perceive this through a man's lens, it's actually pretty brilliant. This is exactly what women must feel, at least frequently, when they see us celebrating masculinity even to toxic levels. Robbie is the perfect choice to portray stereotypical Barbie, and that's purely because she can make us feel for the character's existential crisis just as much as we can adore her looks.The film's binding strength, however, is Ryan Gosling's Ken. As the film progressed, it almost felt like if this were a movie about Barbie questioning her existence and just fighting Mattel's idea of corporate villainy, that would've been clichéd. Ken's presence adds an intriguing layer - when he and Barbie make it to the real world, and concludes that ""men rule the real world"", he becomes the antithesis. He gathers all Kens in Barbieland and makes them acknowledge patriarchy. At this point, as much as I was entertained by Ken's antics, Barbie's realizations, and the wonderful production design, costumes, and soundtrack, I wasn't sure how Gerwig would tackle the final act. The first two acts came across as both sides being somewhat toxic, what with the sidelining of the opposite gender for no apparent reason.But, the final act is a masterstroke. Other than Gerwig's decision NOT to fully antagonize the corporate that manufactures Barbie dolls (and their excessive product placements), because well, they co-produced it, the writing is brilliant. The fact that they allowed Gerwig to go this far itself is refreshing. It acknowledges errors on both ends, and understands how a balance is entirely significant. It asks Ken to stand on his own two feet, without having Barbie by his side always. It also pays tribute to Barbie's creator (for all her faults, including tax evasion), adding a couple of conversational scenes featuring her and Margot's Barbie that gives the latter some level of character closure.

Interesting satire that doesn't always hit the mark,"This is a weirdly complicated film. I wish I could say that was meant to be a compliment, but I found myself trying to figure out where all the pieces fit as the story unraveled.The basic premise seems simple enough and the jokes in the first 30 minutes were pretty funny, but then you introduce ""real world"" characters into the movie after the first act (as shown in the trailer) and it seems to lose its way. Add to that an oversimplification of the male predicament and expected role in society set against an attempt at a nuanced view of the female's expected role and you're left with...mush?Again, it has some decent satire one moment, but then also attempts to show heart the next. One example is how Ken discovers masculinity, but the way a 10 Year old boy might (trucks and horses), yet Barbie sometimes spouts off a simpleton's take on Camus or Neitzche. Honestly, at some points, there's a weird existential dread that flows out of her mouth, but Ken is kind of a moron.Anyone who views men and women like this in real life might have a hard time maintaining long term, meaningful relationships and should probably seek therapy.I wanted to like this more than I could.",interest satir doesnt alway hit mark,thi weirdli complic film i wish i could say meant compliment i found tri figur piec fit stori unraveledth basic premis seem simpl enough joke first minut pretti funni introduc real world charact movi first act shown trailer seem lose way add oversimplif male predica expect role societi set attempt nuanc view femal expect role your left withmushagain decent satir one moment also attempt show heart next one exampl ken discov masculin way year old boy might truck hors yet barbi sometim spout simpleton take camu neitzch honestli point there weird existenti dread flow mouth ken kind moronanyon view men woman like real life might hard time maintain long term meaning relationship probabl seek therapyi want like i could
Flash weird fun that surpasses expectations.,"4.5 out of 5 stars.Barbie is a pretty good fantasy comedy film that delivers all expectations with a film being based on a beloved doll and toy brand. It is fun. It is dumb in a fun way that adults and children will love which has a story with a theme. Humor and fun characters.Margot Robbie delivers as Barbie. And along with Ryan Gosling as Ken. And rest of the cast ensemble had fun with there roles. Its a story about Barbie played by Margot Robbie who decides to leave barbieland after she has been feeling different about herself. While coming into the real world with Ken. To find out who has been playing with her doll version.Humor is a lot of fun that is entertaining in about every scene. The music soundtrack is awesome. The flashy visuals can be cheesy and knows how to be fun and not taken seriously.Overall, it is one fun summer film that everyone will enjoy.",flash weird fun surpass expect,starsbarbi pretti good fantasi comedi film deliv expect film base belov doll toy brand it fun it dumb fun way adult child love stori theme humor fun charactersmargot robbi deliv barbi and along ryan gosl ken and rest cast ensembl fun role it stori barbi play margot robbi decid leav barbieland feel differ while come real world ken to find play doll versionhumor lot fun entertain everi scene the music soundtrack awesom the flashi visual cheesi know fun taken seriouslyoveral one fun summer film everyon enjoy
It is not groundbreaking as people claim it to be,"The 2023 Barbie movie is a whimsical and colorful adventure that aims to entertain its target audience of children but falls somewhat short for a broader viewership, warranting a 6/10 rating.One of the film's strengths lies in its vibrant and imaginative visual design. The animated world of Barbie is brought to life with bright colors, elaborate sets, and a wide array of characters, all of which are sure to captivate young viewers. The film's commitment to creating a visually stimulating environment is evident throughout.The film's protagonist, Barbie, is portrayed as a strong and determined character, encouraging themes of empowerment and self-confidence for young girls, which is a commendable aspect of the movie's messaging. The voice acting, led by the talented Margot Robbie as Barbie, is well-executed, bringing energy and charisma to the characters.However, the film's narrative feels somewhat formulaic and predictable. While it's understandable that children's movies often adhere to certain storytelling conventions, this one doesn't bring much novelty to the table. The plot follows a predictable trajectory, and the conflicts and resolutions are easily foreseen.Additionally, the humor in the film may not resonate as strongly with adult audiences, lacking the clever wit and multi-layered jokes that make family films enjoyable for viewers of all ages. This can limit the movie's appeal beyond its primary demographic.The soundtrack and musical numbers are catchy and fun, contributing to the film's overall lively atmosphere. These moments, along with the film's positive messages of friendship and self-acceptance, are highlights that provide genuine charm.In conclusion, the 2023 Barbie movie fulfills its intended purpose of entertaining and inspiring young audiences, particularly those who are fans of the iconic doll. Its visual design, positive messaging, and enthusiastic voice acting are commendable. However, it falls short of achieving wider appeal due to its predictable plot and humor that may not resonate with older viewers, resulting in a 6/10 rating.",it groundbreak peopl claim,the barbi movi whimsic color adventur aim entertain target audienc child fall somewhat short broader viewership warrant ratingon film strength lie vibrant imagin visual design the anim world barbi brought life bright color elabor set wide array charact sure captiv young viewer the film commit creat visual stimul environ evid throughoutth film protagonist barbi portray strong determin charact encourag theme empower selfconfid young girl commend aspect movi messag the voic act led talent margot robbi barbi wellexecut bring energi charisma charactershowev film narr feel somewhat formula predict while understand child movi often adher certain storytel convent one doesnt bring much novelti tabl the plot follow predict trajectori conflict resolut easili foreseenaddit humor film may reson strongli adult audienc lack clever wit multilay joke make famili film enjoy viewer age thi limit movi appeal beyond primari demographicth soundtrack music number catchi fun contribut film overal live atmospher these moment along film posit messag friendship selfaccept highlight provid genuin charmin conclus barbi movi fulfil intend purpos entertain inspir young audienc particularli fan icon doll it visual design posit messag enthusiast voic act commend howev fall short achiev wider appeal due predict plot humor may reson older viewer result rate
In your face shallowness,"I was really excited to see this movie when I saw it was in the making a year ago. Even more so when the trailer released, I loved the 2001 Space Odyssey reference.When it finally came out, and started to hear the reviews, the excitement slowly went away to the point I didn't watch in the theater, but waited to stream it at home.I finally watched it and the critiques were not wrong. It is so incredibly in your face, preachy and just plain unengaging.I didn't care for a single character. It is very obvious what they were going for, with the whole existentialist premise, but the dialogues were as deep and emotional as a tumblr post(When that was a thing)There were very specific parts I enjoyed, but overall, it was not a good or lasting movie experience.The set pieces in Barbieland were gorgeous, the costumes too, and the last scene with Ruth Handler was really nice, loved the light effects and the use of the Billie Eilish song, it would have been a very emotionally powerful scene had there been a better movie before it.However, I appreciate the fact that in the end it doesn't pick a ''side'', but rather gives the message that men and women need each other, and that a matriarchy or a patriarchy is not the ideal world they think it is in the beginning.",in face shallow,i realli excit see movi i saw make year ago even trailer releas i love space odyssey referencewhen final came start hear review excit slowli went away point i didnt watch theater wait stream homei final watch critiqu wrong it incred face preachi plain unengagingi didnt care singl charact it obviou go whole existentialist premis dialogu deep emot tumblr postwhen thingther specif part i enjoy overal good last movi experienceth set piec barbieland gorgeou costum last scene ruth handler realli nice love light effect use billi eilish song would emot power scene better movi ithowev i appreci fact end doesnt pick side rather give messag men woman need matriarchi patriarchi ideal world think begin
A Classic Screwball Comedy,"Pushing all of the serious reviews aside for a moment, this is a classic comedy of the thirties, updated for our times. Screwball comedies like ""Bombshell"" with Harlow and ""My Man Godfrey"" were wonderful satires. They centered around a battle of the sexes, with a female character dominant over the male lead. They were loaded with farcical situations and spoofing, as well as lots of physical comedy.And like ""Christmas in Connecticut"", they often had a gentle but serious 'message' at the end, and America loved it. The woman is always smarter, generally with a plan up her sleeve, the male lead (most of the men in the movie) are oblivious. The more self-important, the more obliviousness they are to what's really going on around them. I'd now love to see Ryan Gosling in a re-make of ""It Happened One Night"", he'd be terrific. Or Margot Robbie in a re-make of ""Some Like It Hot"".",a classic screwbal comedi,push seriou review asid moment classic comedi thirti updat time screwbal comedi like bombshel harlow my man godfrey wonder satir they center around battl sex femal charact domin male lead they load farcic situat spoof well lot physic comedyand like christma connecticut often gentl seriou messag end america love the woman alway smarter gener plan sleev male lead men movi oblivi the selfimport oblivi what realli go around id love see ryan gosl remak it happen one night hed terrif or margot robbi remak some like it hot
Must We Be Told Everything,"I was genuinely curious to see Barbie and what this director could do with this iconic American character. The look of the film is spot on and does a nice and fun job of creating the bubble gum pink world of Barbie. The basic story idea is solid and I was ready for it. Unfortunately, there was so much exposition going on throughout that I was never really able to go much deeper into the proceedings beyond the visuals. The acting was solid and there were moments of both fun and joy spotted throughout, but sadly for the viewer those were few and far between. It could have been so much more, but instead it devolved into a preachy, pandering slog of a production full of missed opportunities.",must we be told everyth,i genuin curiou see barbi director could icon american charact the look film spot nice fun job creat bubbl gum pink world barbi the basic stori idea solid i readi unfortun much exposit go throughout i never realli abl go much deeper proceed beyond visual the act solid moment fun joy spot throughout sadli viewer far it could much instead devolv preachi pander slog product full miss opportun

And as far as the depth of the 'message' is concerned, all I can say to the writers and director is: do not give up your day job.There is nothing wrong with delivering an important message, however, to be effective it must be done with persuasion and not a sledgehammer.

"""This Barbie is far from plastic. It's fantastic"".","I finally had the chance to watch the wonderful Barbie movie, and I must say, it did not disappoint me at all. In fact, it surpassed my expectations! Barbie turned out to be much more than what I initially imagined-it's truly remarkable!One thing I really liked was how Greta addressed all the criticisms about Barbie while infusing a feminist twist into the doll (Barbie was the first doll which had power of chosing). Gerwig's take on childhood and the patriarchy and feminism and love and death resonated throughout the film, adding an extra layer of depth and thought-provoking themes. I found myself both shedding a few tears and laughing heartily. The movie was incredibly humorous and touched upon meaningful aspects of life.I took my 11-year-old niece to see it, and she loved it too (although I'm sure some of the social points might have gone over her head).The sets, hair, and costumes were absolutely outstanding. The cast delivered stunning performances: America Ferrera gave a deeply moving speech, and Ryan Gosling's performance stole the show, proving many, myself included, wrong about his suitability for the role.Lastly, I must mention Margot Robbie, who was simply stunning and the perfect fit for Barbie. She was naive, sweet, and camp, all wrapped up in a ""stereotypical Barbie"". Although Anne Hathaway and Amy Schumer were previously associated with the project, I am delighted that Margot Robbie made it happen.""This Barbie is far from plastic.

Could be better,Started well including the scene where Barbie removes her feet from her shoes and remains the same shape (as per the trailer) but after Barbie and the characters were introduced the script began to lose its way. As though the writer tried to include little memories or what would be nice rather than a theme or good story throughout. If you have nothing to do worth watching but if you are expecting laughs or a wow factor don't expect too much. I think also instead of directing to children and adults just stick to one or other. Actors were all good but the story just let them down. Hopefully not a trilogy on the way.,could better,start well includ scene barbi remov foot shoe remain shape per trailer barbi charact introduc script began lose way a though writer tri includ littl memori would nice rather theme good stori throughout if noth worth watch expect laugh wow factor dont expect much i think also instead direct child adult stick one actor good stori let hope trilog way

"A ""Barbie"" girl on the loose from her ""Barbie"" world, a fun mixed film of fantasy and reality.","Being a boy growing up I was never a ""Barbie"" doll collector, always had mostly ""Star Wars"", ""WWF"", and ""He Man"" figures, yet I like all others knew the impact and cultural historical vibe of the Mattel toy line. This film from director Greta Gerwig which blends the toy and real worlds together, so well showing what it's like to deal with being accepted into reality with people who have loved you as a toy doll. The movie rightfully called ""Barbie"" is a fun one a real sentimental journey a film really of escape, fantasy, a touching adventure that's blended with comedy and drama. The acting and on screen chemistry is in top notch form with ""Barbie""(the beautiful and sexy attractive Margot Robbie) and ""Ken""(Ryan Gosling) as they live in the colorful and magical playland life it all seems just a dream, only when signs of malfunction and a hint that ""Barbie"" might be human the film changes. As going into the real world to search for the cure to become a toy again offers plenty of moments that have you as a viewer laughing and feeling emotions as you really along, with the central character feel the compare and contrast and weigh the choices and decisions that humans must make, and the real world even sees the ""Barbie"" toys in a different light.

Could it ever meet expectations?,"Barbie Movie Review
She's a Barbie girl (who is having an existential crisis) in the Barbie world. Life isn't so fantastic. So she decides to head to the 'real world' with Ken because we've got everything sorted over here right?The film highlights the paradox that is Barbie... and owns it. It would seem that they wrote a pros and cons list and tackled every item on it. Was Barbie an astronaut before women were allowed credit cards? Yes. Has she perpetuated unachievable body image stereotypes? Yes. Do they address both of these issues and everything in between - 100%. Even Mattel, the makers of Barbie and this film, aren't safe, poking fun at their own lack of diversity hiring.The experience feels very intimate, getting up close with Margot Robbie. From the literal extreme close ups to the emotion she manages to give when bringing a kids toy to life. Robbie commits to the role but never comes across as ditzy or dumb, growing more with every scene.However Ryan Gosling doesn't shift out of cheeseball mode but clearly relishes the chance to ham it up as a Himbo.The narration from Helen Mirren, although brief, is one of the highlights. Punctuating moments with her dry British wit.The message of inequality is prevalent in every line of this film and although it's an extremely important message, it could have been done without bashing you over the head with it for 2 hours.Mums and Dads will love the nostalgia and the occasional double entendre. Girls and boys will have fun while hopefully absorbing her (not so subtle) message.By Nick

I'd probably drop it at around 1/2 if I watched it alone at home,"Attending the prepremiere of the much-anticipated Barbie movie was an experience I won't soon forget, but unfortunately, not for the right reasons. At least 85% of the movie was pure hype, creating high expectations that were ultimately let down.The film seemed primarily aimed at a teenage audience, with its trendy aesthetics and themes, but it struggled to find its identity. It swung between childish and adultish elements, making it challenging to categorize and leaving viewers like me feeling a bit perplexed about its target demographic.In the first two-thirds of the movie, I managed to find a few moments to laugh, but my interest began to wane as it entered the final third. The lack of a compelling plot and engaging storytelling made it a tedious watch, and I found myself almost falling asleep in the cinema.One of the major letdowns was the extensive marketing that overshadowed the entire experience. What made the movie even more uncomfortable for me was the audience's overwhelming obsession with everything pink. Nearly 90% of the cinema-goers were dressed in various shades of pink, and it felt like an extravagant posing session rather than an immersive movie experience. It did not help that movie itself was pretty average - it heavily depends on references and superficial jokes, which can be amusing on occasion. However, after being exposed to nearly two hours of such content, I was completely brain damaged .I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from a Barbie movie, but this certainly wasn't it. It fell into the same pit as some of Disney's live-action adaptations that fail to capture the essence of the original material.Despite having a few moments of laughter and initial intrigue, I wouldn't rate it more than 4 out of 10.

Positively surprised,"Addresses current critical issues; basically, the movie revolves around that. The central ideas are patriarchy and female empowerment, which I believe were handled intelligently and elegantly. I was particularly surprised in this regard; I didn't expect the film to be so mature.I also want to highlight the makeup, set, photography and choreography. Top-notch, flawless.The context is also interesting; the script is creative, and the story is engaging, making the film much more fluid. Personally that's what I liked the most, how the fantasy and the reality interact. The actors were amazing too, and not only the main characters.Some other human characters were underdeveloped compared to Barbie and Ken, but that was expected.As a man I recon that this is a movie that speaks to women, but also to men sensible to women struggles. I went to watch it without expecting more than a visually beautiful film, and I left the cinema positively surprised.",posit surpris,address current critic issu basic movi revolv around the central idea patriarchi femal empower i believ handl intellig elegantli i particularli surpris regard i didnt expect film maturei also want highlight makeup set photographi choreographi topnotch flawlessth context also interest script creativ stori engag make film much fluid person that i like fantasi realiti interact the actor amaz main characterssom human charact underdevelop compar barbi ken expecteda man i recon movi speak woman also men sensibl woman struggl i went watch without expect visual beauti film i left cinema posit surpris
Strange film - like Twilight Zone or Black Mirror,"Barbie is a weird film that is pretty well made. It tells the story of how one of many Barbie's in Barbie-land leave and go into the real world to find the person who owns them as a toy. In the real world, they see what impact Barbie has, or fails to have, as a product on the minds of young girl consumers. This information changes her, and Ken's opinion of themselves and they return home and deal with the aftermath of this revelation.Barbie is well played by Margot Robbie who is an excellent actress and is perfectly cast in the role. While Ryan Gosling is a strange choice for Ken he does adequate work as Ken and gives depth and subtext to the otherwise shallow one dimensional Barbie-companion.This movie poses a lot of questions, makes some strange decisions, and has some intelligent (albeit shallow) things to say about the relationship between boys and girls. (Not men and women, but boys and girls.).It's worth watching - but memorable more in how weird it is rather than how good it is.",strang film like twilight zone black mirror,barbi weird film pretti well made it tell stori one mani barbi barbieland leav go real world find person own toy in real world see impact barbi fail product mind young girl consum thi inform chang ken opinion return home deal aftermath revelationbarbi well play margot robbi excel actress perfectli cast role while ryan gosl strang choic ken adequ work ken give depth subtext otherwis shallow one dimension barbiecompanionthi movi pose lot question make strang decis intellig albeit shallow thing say relationship boy girl not men woman boy girlsit worth watch memor weird rather good
Pointing out sexism by being sexist,"I was never into Barbie as a child because I thought she's just a boring toy. The operative word being - toy. So when the controversy started about her impossibly small waist, sky high beauty standards, white skin and blonde hair, I thought some people just have too much time on their hands or because they're just jealous at someone else's success. It's easier to blast someone else's hard work rather than strike it out on your own and keep doing it.The way children perceive toys remain unchanged. A young child who picks up a Barbie will not immediately think (if at all) they must aspire to have the doll's physique. Children play with toys out of enjoyment and by using their innocent imagination, they don't think about the underlying message or intention behind every toy. The politicising comes from some adults who can scream the loudest and longest. Ruth Handler created Barbie after seeing her daughter playing with a paper doll, she wasn't into politics or trying to change cultural standards.Gerwig's Barbie is an example of an adult using a doll to scream her many, many lectures to the masses. The movie looks like it's for children and teenagers but the script is the opposite. This is where it becomes confusing and the storyline thin. Too many speeches aiming at the patriarchy control, pointing out that it's a sexist world controlled by men but showing all men in this movie as idiots.The portrayal of men is very black and white stereotyping. Barbie (Robbie) goes into the real human world and she's heckled by men at the beach and if that's not a clear enough message, she visits a construction site where, you guessed it, the men starts to make derogatory comments as well. Then there's the Mattel HQ where it's of course run by men in suits who are naturally, idiots. One of the lower ranked male employee (Swindells) even say, ""I'm a man with no power, does that make me a woman?"" (What's with half of the Sex Education actors cast in this movie. The brilliant Ncuti Gatwa playing a hetero Ken!?)At just under two hours, you can guess why that is - there's not much else going for it so the soundtrack plays a big part in driving the narrative to the point, you're wondering if this is a movie or a music channel. The second half descends into a weird but clumsy attempt at humour that a child would find boring.Robbie and Gosling do a decent job with the flat material they were given. Barbie is an iconc doll and that's all she is, a toy - so a movie keeping to that theme without the controversy would have been more entertaining. And in case you're so numb from all the preachiness, the Trump and his wall sideswipe under a guise of a joke shows how the writers just wanted to cover as many 'isms' as possible by using Barbie as a prop.",point sexism sexist,i never barbi child i thought she bore toy the oper word toy so controversi start imposs small waist sky high beauti standard white skin blond hair i thought peopl much time hand theyr jealou someon el success it easier blast someon el hard work rather strike keep itth way child perceiv toy remain unchang a young child pick barbi immedi think must aspir doll physiqu child play toy enjoy use innoc imagin dont think underli messag intent behind everi toy the politicis come adult scream loudest longest ruth handler creat barbi see daughter play paper doll wasnt polit tri chang cultur standardsgerwig barbi exampl adult use doll scream mani mani lectur mass the movi look like child teenag script opposit thi becom confus storylin thin too mani speech aim patriarchi control point sexist world control men show men movi idiotsth portray men black white stereotyp barbi robbi goe real human world she heckl men beach that clear enough messag visit construct site guess men start make derogatori comment well then there mattel hq cours run men suit natur idiot one lower rank male employe swindel even say im man power make woman what half sex educ actor cast movi the brilliant ncuti gatwa play hetero kenat two hour guess there much el go soundtrack play big part drive narr point your wonder movi music channel the second half descend weird clumsi attempt humour child would find boringrobbi gosl decent job flat materi given barbi iconc doll that toy movi keep theme without controversi would entertain and case your numb preachi trump wall sideswip gui joke show writer want cover mani ism possibl use barbi prop
Deep Meaning Behind Seemingly Innocent Facade,"Entering the cinema with the expectation of a colorful and girly adventure, I was surprised to find that this movie delved into deeper societal issues, transcending its supposed joyful facade. It skillfully addressed complex topics within a simple narrative, which captivated me. Despite its innocent appearance, the film was profoundly moving, evoking feelings of sadness, frustration, and anger. Watching it led me to embrace feminism but acknowledge that men also face their own issues. The movie's creator intended to shed light on the intricacies of being a woman, and the portrayal of Ken feeling left out highlights one of the many challenges women encounter daily in the real world.

Recent memory sees him leading roles that require a more stoic subdued approach, and it can be easy to miss his range. Barbie seeks to utilize all his acting muscles, and to a resounding success. He can sing, dance, act, and do comedy.It wouldn't be totally outrageous to suggest he is the star of the movie. Of course, he is one of the stars, but I would posit he is THE star of Barbie's movie.I was left wondering if the Ken story arc was the stronger theme of the film. Overall, I felt an absurdist philosophy underlined the film. There was a feminist message, sure, but it wasn't as nuanced as Ken's perspective on the patriarchy. At one point, Gosling's Ken quips ""When I found out patriarchy wasn't about horses, I lost interest.""Ken's attitude speaks to the idea that most likely the majority of men could care less about a patriarchy or how the world works. They're on the ride like everyone else and playing a role in the fantasy of getting a gal to look there way. In essence, the reality is Ken is only Ken in relation to Barbie being Barbie and the truth is everyone is an Allan.",ryan gosl pure showman,if forgotten ryan gosl start mickey mous club import rememb wow talent individu recent memori see lead role requir stoic subdu approach easi miss rang barbi seek util act muscl resound success he sing danc act comedyit wouldnt total outrag suggest star movi of cours one star i would posit the star barbi moviei left wonder ken stori arc stronger theme film overal i felt absurdist philosophi underlin film there feminist messag sure wasnt nuanc ken perspect patriarchi at one point gosl ken quip when i found patriarchi wasnt hors i lost interestken attitud speak idea like major men could care le patriarchi world work theyr ride like everyon el play role fantasi get gal look way in essenc realiti ken ken relat barbi barbi truth everyon allan
Best movie ever!,"This might just be the best movie I've ever seen. The more I think about it, the more I realize just how genius it is! I mean they really thought out every little detail!My favorite part is that: if you love this movie, you get the movie. And if you hate the movie, you also get the movie. It truly is a movie for people who love it and hate it. It's for everyone.I'd like to talk about the genius of this plot for a moment. We start off in a matriarchal society. However, it's a society created by little girls, so the Barbies are not violent towards the Kens. They just aren't obsessed with the Kens. The Kens are just in the background, this is representative of how children girls feel. Then, we go into the real world and we are introduced to a patriarchal society. But not just any patriarchal society. It's a society created by adults. So we see toxic masculinity and we see violent tendencies. Then, we go back to Barbieland and Ken brings all of his knowledge of the patriarchy with him. He creates a toxic meninist movement, which emphasizes the point that extremism is not the answer. We cannot overcorrect a mistake or it will cause more mistakes. The Kens start to become violent, even towards each other. This is a good representation of what women deal with in the real world. We can't even rely on each other sometimes. Women can be hateful towards each other as well. Finally, the movie comes to a close with Barbie taking a small step in the right direction. She says it doesn't have to be ""Barbie and Ken"", ""it's Barbie and it's Ken"". Now here's we're people start to get pissed. Barbie just got done saying that the Barbie's and Ken's need to start living as equals, but when when of the Kens asks to be on the Supreme Court the President Barbie says no that's too far, let's start with maybe a cabinet member or something.... Wow how could they... just kidding. You're SUPPOSED TO BE ANGRY about this! This is an accurate representation of the real world! The movie literally ends with the Barbie world being an exact replica of the real world, only with the gender roles reversed.Another thing I'd like to point out is that even Ken says at the end that he didn't really like patriarchy anyway. He just wanted to ride horses. Again, this is because he is a doll in a world created by children. I think there's a lot to unpack here but my overall take was that the world is a better place from the POV of a child and adults are the ones who are ruining everything. Even Mattel is kind of shown as a ""bad guy"" in the movie, but even they say, they didn't make Barbie for her to become a sexualized standard. They made Barbie to allow girls to dream of more than just being a mother. With Barbie they can be anything they want to be. It wasn't until adults came along and taught us to sexualize Barbie, that we started to hold her to a different standard.I think most people watch this movie and see the beauty and the genius of it. I think a few hateful people will watch this movie with their tainted glasses and their preconceived biases and they will get very close to understanding it. Every person I've see criticizing this movie, I'm like you're SO CLOSE to the point. You're basically running head first into it. That is the most frustrating and the most gratifying thing about this movie. It's a trap. You can't say hateful things about it, without PROVING THE POINT OF THE MOVIE!",best movi ever,thi might best movi ive ever seen the i think i realiz geniu i mean realli thought everi littl detailmi favorit part love movi get movi and hate movi also get movi it truli movi peopl love hate it everyoneid like talk geniu plot moment we start matriarch societi howev societi creat littl girl barbi violent toward ken they arent ob ken the ken background repres child girl feel then go real world introduc patriarch societi but patriarch societi it societi creat adult so see toxic masculin see violent tendenc then go back barbieland ken bring knowledg patriarchi he creat toxic meninist movement emphas point extrem answer we overcorrect mistak caus mistak the ken start becom violent even toward thi good represent woman deal real world we cant even reli sometim woman hate toward well final movi come close barbi take small step right direct she say doesnt barbi ken barbi ken now here peopl start get piss barbi got done say barbi ken need start live equal ken ask suprem court presid barbi say that far let start mayb cabinet member someth wow could kid your suppos to be angri thi accur represent real world the movi liter end barbi world exact replica real world gender role reversedanoth thing id like point even ken say end didnt realli like patriarchi anyway he want ride hors again doll world creat child i think there lot unpack overal take world better place pov child adult one ruin everyth even mattel kind shown bad guy movi even say didnt make barbi becom sexual standard they made barbi allow girl dream mother with barbi anyth want it wasnt adult came along taught u sexual barbi start hold differ standardi think peopl watch movi see beauti geniu i think hate peopl watch movi taint glass preconceiv bias get close understand everi person ive see critic movi im like your so close point your basic run head first that frustrat gratifi thing movi it trap you cant say hate thing without prove the point of the movi
Ryan Gosling is the main character,"Ryan Gosling acting was so good that is seemed that he as Ken is the main character.Physically Margot was a great choice, but she didn't give much. Even when she had the opportunity to act more human, her expressions and acting were still more as a doll, and Ryan did a better job.I didn't know what to expect but I was hoping that it will not be too superficial, and it wasn't. The movie is light, with some smart things said. It was a bit too long and became little boring in the middle but after all it was fun to watch. Loved the music, costumes, choreography.

It's a good movie,"'Barbie' has more to it than I would've predicted. It's a good movie.I steer clear of as much film promo as possible, so was kinda expecting this to be more of a 'proper' comedy - just an assumption on my part. It does have humour but it's far from the film's main thing, there are a few chucklesome moments but I found it to be more earnest than funny.It does get a tiny bit moralistic, though undoubtedly has the right intentions and does certainly hit the nail on the head with certain points. The story itself is interesting, I like that they didn't lean deep into the usual fish out of water stuff when Barbie visits the real world. I enjoy how the world is set, with the multiple Barbies and Kens etc.The cast are great. Margot Robbie is top notch - the perfect choice. Ryan Gosling is excellent as well, while America Ferrera, Will Ferrell and Michael Cera are positives too. Away from those onscreen, the look of the film is splendid and the soundtrack fits well - even if Charli XCX's track is the only one I'd intentionally listen to.All in all, glad I watched this. I'd recommend it, even if my mum (who I watched this with, fwiw) wouldn't. 😄",it good movi,barbi i wouldv predict it good moviei steer clear much film promo possibl kinda expect proper comedi assumpt part it humour far film main thing chucklesom moment i found earnest funnyit get tini bit moralist though undoubtedli right intent certainli hit nail head certain point the stori interest i like didnt lean deep usual fish water stuff barbi visit real world i enjoy world set multipl barbi ken etcth cast great margot robbi top notch perfect choic ryan gosl excel well america ferrera will ferrel michael cera posit away onscreen look film splendid soundtrack fit well even charli xcx track one id intent listen toall glad i watch id recommend even mum i watch fwiw wouldnt
Unwatchable,"I was eager to see Barbie once it became available on Max. I streamed it the first night it was available. There go two hours I'll never get back. I don't understand the hype, Barbie is dreadful. Barbie in perfect pink Barbieland surrounded by other Barbies with all males named Ken (except for Allen, an unfunny addition) experiences a glitch in her perfect world so heads to ""reality"" to find the problem. Ken tags along to LA where they discover the real world is run by men and they've made a mess of it. Barblie learns to cry, Ken leans into his manhood, and when both return to Barbieland the Ken dolls have taken over and made a mess of that world. Barbies to the rescue, the starring Barbie meets her creator, and heads back to reality where she gives the last and ONLY funny line in the movie. Terrible. Save yourselves and take a hard pass on Barbie.",unwatch,i eager see barbi becam avail max i stream first night avail there go two hour ill never get back i dont understand hype barbi dread barbi perfect pink barbieland surround barbi male name ken except allen unfunni addit experi glitch perfect world head realiti find problem ken tag along la discov real world run men theyv made mess barbli learn cri ken lean manhood return barbieland ken doll taken made mess world barbi rescu star barbi meet creator head back realiti give last onli funni line movi terribl save take hard pas barbi
"Great, but Heavy Message in a Fun Movie","Now this was a movie that originally, I had no interest in seeing. Seeing all these people have meltdowns about it piqued my interest. My wife, Jaime, was in a similar boat. We wanted to go see it in the theater, but having a newborn at the time didn't help. This ended up being one that she streamed on Max.What we get here is following the life of Barbie (Margot Robbie). Later, we will learn that she isn't one of the versions that has a set job. She is stereotypical. We meet other Barbies like the president, played by Issa Rae. There are writers, scientists and other important positions. We also meet Ken (Ryan Gosling). He is friends with other Kens and even has a rivalry with Ken, played by Simu Liu. I also wanted to bring up Allan (Michael Cera) who is an awkward friend who was a discontinued doll.Now things all change when Barbie has deep thoughts that break her perfect facade. She then goes to an odd Barbie (Kate McKinnon). She directs her to the real world and seek out the child that is playing with her to see if this can break her funk. This leads her to Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) and her mother, Gloria (America Ferrera), who works at Mattel. This leads Barbie on a journey that will shake the fabric of her world, see how things are in the real world and try to fix things before it is too late.I think that should recap the story without going too in-depth. Where I want to start is that I can see why people love this and others hate it. The argument for the latter is that this is too heavy handed with its commentary. I think the problem there is that it is right and people just don't want to hear it. We live in a patriarchy. Men control this world and even though there are exaggerated things that happen in this movie, it also is dead on with things as well. Ken also brings these ideas back to Barbie Land and that leads to a funny as well as scary version.Let me then switch gears a bit. I watched this for the first time and a newer parent to a daughter, Mackenzie. This made me tear up, because I don't want her to be treated second class and at a disadvantage to start. I'm hoping that through movies like this or just these issues being brought up that real change can be made. Does this go over the top? Yes, but I think that it does both ways. This shows that having a woman dominated society is bad, which is how Barbie Land was. When the Kens take over, it is equally bad. We need balance here. I think that is what both sides are missing while watching this. What I will say is that we are skewed one way and things still need to be balanced to fix that.Where I'll then take this is to the acting. This is presented in a comedic fashion so the acting is over the top. Robbie is perfectly cast as Barbie to me. What makes it even better, this movie acknowledges things when it goes bleak and she feels 'ugly'. That was a good move. Robbie is a solid actor so that also helps. The rest of the Barbies are solid with Rae, McKinnon and the like. Gosling, Liu and the other Kens are also good. I love that this acknowledges that Ken is not Barbie's husband, but her companion. I definitely need to credit Ferrera here. She steals the show with her speech. I like Greenblatt in her role pointing out that Barbie does have sexist aspects and those need to be acknowledged. This stems from how the doll is built as it is unrealistic. Other than that, Cera is funny. Rhea Perlman is good in her role. Helen Mirren is the narrator. We also have Will Ferrell in a fun cameo. The acting here just works.Where I'll end out is that this is well-made. Barbie Land is dreamlike and like a fairy tale. There is a good duality how it isn't that much different from the real world, but it still is. That worked for me. We have CGI, but again that is showcasing things that are out of the normal which worked for me. There aren't a lot of effects, but enough to notice. This has a lot of money behind it, so it doesn't look bad. Other than that, I like things they do with the soundtrack. Not the greatest but works for the framework. Ahead of seeing this, keep in mind what I've said here. If you know this is going to trigger you or it's not for you, I'd move on. There is a good message here and it's a fun movie to boot.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",great heavi messag fun movi,now movi origin i interest see see peopl meltdown piqu interest my wife jaim similar boat we want go see theater newborn time didnt help thi end one stream maxwhat get follow life barbi margot robbi later learn isnt one version set job she stereotyp we meet barbi like presid play issa rae there writer scientist import posit we also meet ken ryan gosl he friend ken even rivalri ken play simu liu i also want bring allan michael cera awkward friend discontinu dollnow thing chang barbi deep thought break perfect facad she goe odd barbi kate mckinnon she direct real world seek child play see break funk thi lead sasha ariana greenblatt mother gloria america ferrera work mattel thi lead barbi journey shake fabric world see thing real world tri fix thing latei think recap stori without go indepth where i want start i see peopl love other hate the argument latter heavi hand commentari i think problem right peopl dont want hear we live patriarchi men control world even though exagger thing happen movi also dead thing well ken also bring idea back barbi land lead funni well scari versionlet switch gear bit i watch first time newer parent daughter mackenzi thi made tear i dont want treat second class disadvantag start im hope movi like issu brought real chang made doe go top ye i think way thi show woman domin societi bad barbi land when ken take equal bad we need balanc i think side miss watch what i say skew one way thing still need balanc fix thatwher ill take act thi present comed fashion act top robbi perfectli cast barbi what make even better movi acknowledg thing goe bleak feel ugli that good move robbi solid actor also help the rest barbi solid rae mckinnon like gosl liu ken also good i love acknowledg ken barbi husband companion i definit need credit ferrera she steal show speech i like greenblatt role point barbi sexist aspect need acknowledg thi stem doll built unrealist other cera funni rhea perlman good role helen mirren narrat we also will ferrel fun cameo the act workswher ill end wellmad barbi land dreamlik like fairi tale there good dualiti isnt much differ real world still that work we cgi showcas thing normal work there arent lot effect enough notic thi lot money behind doesnt look bad other i like thing soundtrack not greatest work framework ahead see keep mind ive said if know go trigger id move there good messag fun movi bootmi rate
"Corny, Watchable, But So Corny","This review will sorta just be a barebones review. There's no spoilers because this movie doesn't really have a plot or resolution that can be spoiled. The movie starts out with a reference from 2001: a space odyssey, Which im sure went right over the target audiences heads. Then breaks into a lot of corny jokes in Barbieland. Barbieland is the best part of the movie, the Barbies performances are all hammed up, kind of like a long progressive commercial. But the acting is supposed to be corny and overacted because they're barbies so I'll accept it. Barbieland has a lot of fun moments with the songs and dances and the beach and Cena. The design of Barbieland and costumes of the Barbies and Kens is why this movie is getting this hype ans it definitely lives up to it. Margot Robbie does a good job as barbie and Gosling as Ken is by far the funniest/best part of the movie. Barbie starts her crisis and goes to the real world and everything starts to suck. Ken finding out about patriarchy is the best thing about the real w orld. The jokes in this movie were really weak, the sentimental serious parts are really boring, this movie feels like it's 2 and 1/2 hours and it's only 1h45. Will Ferrell shows up but they forgot to write jokes for him. America Ferrera gives the most genuine performance but her character is devoid of logic and ends up just giving a long lecture. Lots of the corny jokes in this movie fall completely flat, but theres so many jokes in this movie that you will laugh at least a little bit. Men are targeted in this movie and it has no idea what subtlety is, but it is a Barbie movie so i can accept that. And most importantly this movie has no conflict resolution at all, they sorta just end the movie on one last moderately silly joke. This movie was sort of just a forgettable comedy with a lot of hype before it. But hey I'm glad it brought people to theaters again and did have a message worth watching even if it was delivered rather weakly.6.2/10.",corni watchabl but so corni,thi review sorta barebon review there spoiler movi doesnt realli plot resolut spoil the movi start refer space odyssey which im sure went right target audienc head then break lot corni joke barbieland barbieland best part movi barbi perform ham kind like long progress commerci but act suppos corni overact theyr barbi ill accept barbieland lot fun moment song danc beach cena the design barbieland costum barbi ken movi get hype an definit live margot robbi good job barbi gosl ken far funniestbest part movi barbi start crisi goe real world everyth start suck ken find patriarchi best thing real w orld the joke movi realli weak sentiment seriou part realli bore movi feel like hour h will ferrel show forgot write joke america ferrera give genuin perform charact devoid logic end give long lectur lot corni joke movi fall complet flat there mani joke movi laugh least littl bit men target movi idea subtleti barbi movi accept and importantli movi conflict resolut sorta end movi one last moder silli joke thi movi sort forgett comedi lot hype but hey im glad brought peopl theater messag worth watch even deliv rather weakli
Hollywood Films have got so bad this is considered good ???!!!,"THE GOOD ... Its bright and colourful ... Rhea Pearlman shows genuine heart ... Helen Mirren is fine as the narrator ... THE BAD ...

The music is dreadful, you can't tell one piece from another ... If this is what studio writers are thinking is creative these days , then the fact is they are wrong and at least as regards Hollywood, AI probably could do better and you should sack the lot of them ... You need to learn that if you write stuff to satisfy the cultures ALL around the world and not upset anyone in the slightest, then you write stuff that doesn't satisfy anyone ...

Barbie is On Her Way to the Oscars,"When I first knew there was a Barbie movie in production, a live action, I thought ""It should be as bad as the others movies""...
When I notice was Greta Gerwig making the movie, my expectation get higher. Then, when I saw the cast, my expectations were even higher!I went to watch this movie in the premiere and I can assure you this movie is a masterpiece.It's purposely not realistic, has an excellent director and an excellent production and story.There are lots of fun moments, but this movie is a satire to the life of Barbie.The fact that compares the dream life of Barbie to the real life in the real world it's fantastic. It's a never seen thing. It compares the women's mistreatment, the real tragedy's... it's a real good idea...

A fun start with a rather boring end,"The first hour of this film was fun and engaging. The humour is quirky and original. It is pretty well-acted and it was refreshing to see a film not take itself too seriously.It's visually brilliant and offers some real escapism. At some point, this changed. It felt like the writers thought, ""We can't just continue to make jokes, we need a story."" And then it fell down.This is about Barbie having some kind of existential crisis; rallying against the past and previous beliefs about women's role in society. And it got kind of boring to be honest; and its light-hearted, satirical edge is lost. It became a little preachy about gender based roles in society.The main message as far as I could tell is that it is ok to be normal, to be average, and ignore the pressure of striving towards excellence and achievement. This is ok, but it just feels flat; and it got lost and because of the entertaining first hour. You just don't know how seriously to take it.This film was seriously hyped up before its release because of its content, its cast and originality, but once watched, it will be quickly forgotten.",a fun start rather bore end,the first hour film fun engag the humour quirki origin it pretti wellact refresh see film take seriouslyit visual brilliant offer real escap at point chang it felt like writer thought we cant continu make joke need stori and fell downthi barbi kind existenti crisi ralli past previou belief woman role societi and got kind bore honest lightheart satir edg lost it becam littl preachi gender base role societyth main messag far i could tell ok normal averag ignor pressur strive toward excel achiev thi ok feel flat got lost entertain first hour you dont know serious take itthi film serious hype releas content cast origin watch quickli forgotten
"a love letter to women, girlhood and growing up outside of a world run by the patriarchy","To me, Barbie was a wonderful exploration of feminity and womanhood while also encompassing themes of patriarchy and the entitlement of men. I wasn't really sure what to expect beforehand but i was truly enjoying it and smiling nearly the whole time. It pains me, how all women and girls will be able to relate to some of the scenes and it angers me so much how men seeing this movie just hate it for the sake of hating something pink and fun.Men aside, i do think it healed something in me, however cliché it sounds and i will gladly rewatch it (would definitely show it to my future daughter, if i planned to have one).

Conflict Barbie,"Barbie offers a delightful and fun-filled experience, encompassing chuckles, joy, and, surprisingly, some deeper discussions surrounding its creation's intended impact on feminism versus the portrayal of opposing views on women in real life. It even delves into the influence of patriarchy, hyper-masculinity, and its effects on the mental and emotional struggles women face daily. Initially, I found myself a bit confused since it wasn't quite what I expected. The movie touched on dark themes like death, which left me wanting more answers, especially since it was mentioned often, but it didn't tie up that loose end.Despite that, the film doesn't target kids but rather adults who once played with Barbies. For the moms out there, it's definitely a movie worth watching.However, I'm conflicted because it felt like the movie couldn't quite decide what it wanted to accomplish. With so many themes and stories to tell, it somewhat detracts from the overall impact. Nevertheless, it remains an enjoyable experience that nostalgically brings back memories. I'd give Barbie The Movie a rating of 7.5/10. The hype, dressing up, and reliving childhood memories add to its appeal.",conflict barbi,barbi offer delight funfil experi encompass chuckl joy surprisingli deeper discus surround creation intend impact femin versu portray oppos view woman real life it even delv influenc patriarchi hypermasculin effect mental emot struggl woman face daili initi i found bit confus sinc wasnt quit i expect the movi touch dark theme like death left want answer especi sinc mention often didnt tie loo enddespit film doesnt target kid rather adult play barbi for mom definit movi worth watchinghowev im conflict felt like movi couldnt quit decid want accomplish with mani theme stori tell somewhat detract overal impact nevertheless remain enjoy experi nostalg bring back memori id give barbi the movi rate the hype dress reliv childhood memori add appeal

Only thing that saved this was good acting and sound track,"Honestly, not too sure what my partner and I were expecting, but we figured it would be a fun, empowering, and sweet movie.Instead, we got a preachy, confused, mess that oscillated between comedy and social commentary in a wildly jarring way.Unfortunately, I think the writers took the opportunity to project their feelings onto the audience. The message seems dated and naive. At best it's a bit of an eye roll, at worst it's an attempt to shame young girls into a self defeating thought process.Acting, sound track, set design, and some bits of comedy were really good, and there is some genuine cinema in there.",onli thing save good act sound track,honestli sure partner i expect figur would fun empow sweet movieinstead got preachi confus mess oscil comedi social commentari wildli jar wayunfortun i think writer took opportun project feel onto audienc the messag seem date naiv at best bit eye roll worst attempt shame young girl self defeat thought processact sound track set design bit comedi realli good genuin cinema
Mattel's love letter to their Creation?,"This film had to be more than advertising Mattel's famous doll, which set the standard for playthings fifty-odd years ago. And getting Greta Gerwig to direct a movie about Barbie, seems to have been a creative masterstroke. As expected, she has delivered a stylish incarnation of the sometimes much-derided doll, and it's a fun movie that carries its serious message quite lightly.It looks spectacular, with Barbieland depicted with so much pink it could be nauseating, but the camera is moved around very skilfully so that images are fleeting. With most of the characters being Ken or Barbie, it is easy to follow, and the audience knows that Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are the pair to follow.The plot is simple enough, with Barbie suffering a trauma that causes her to visit the real world where some shattering illusions cause her to rethink her role as a female icon. Robbie is stunning in this role, she has always shone in playing over the top characters, and Barbie has given her plenty of scope for this. She is matched by a superb Ryan Gosling, clearly enjoying playing a downtrodden male who gets a chance to avenge his status, and the rest of the cast are all good as well, particularly America Ferrera as a Mattel employee who sees through the Barbie dream, and Will Ferrell, being the usual Will Ferrell as the boss of Mattel.I really enjoyed the film, but the second part was somewhat overlong. Gerwig also couldn't resist getting into a preachy mode as the ending approached. I docked two stars for that, but otherwise this film was the tonic the film industry needed.

Dense Scripting Saves Oddball Premise,"This is a film that should not have worked. It wants to go from goofy, to serious, to moralistic, to sentimental, all at once. Which is similar to the multi-tone ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"". Both movies try to juggle different tones and themes and both succeed for the most part. One thing Barbie has going in its favour is that it knows its limitations and mercifully clocks in less than two hours. The script explores many aspects of the aura of the Barbie doll and its legacy. This is a fresh topic that alone provides interesting insight. An original premise in the world of cookie-cutter franchise sequels. Both the positive and negative aspects of what the Barbie doll represents is addressed without holding back. Amazingly, even the Mattel corporation itself is lampooned. So the script is not only allowed to address less popular characteristics about the doll, but finds real insight about what Barbie and Ken represent to young kids compared the more mature adult world.But a script normally can't have its cake and eat it to. It's a lighthearted trip into Barbieland, but also finds true sadness in how we give up our active imagination once we get older, and the need to be serious about the real world. Not only that, but it delivers straight forward lessons about a male dominated society and how woman are rarely given positions of power. Give credit to co-writer and director Greta Gerwig for mastering all things Barbie, sticking it all in a blender, and making a cohesive piece of work that transcends expectations for a movie based on a toy doll. Give credit to the powers that be that took a chance on such an unlikely hit movie and keeps the narrative moving along in engaging and unpredictable ways.Not that one could make this movie with other actors in the lead roles, but the persona and especially the physical likeness of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling seem to be a perfect match. Robbie especially brings a heartfelt sadness in a couple of scenes that make her character more than one dimensional, despite being based on a plastic doll. Gosling brings his lighthearted personality to the role of Ken convincingly, yet allowing the one dimensional character to wish for a sense of belonging.I also really enjoyed how the script made comparisons of the plastic world of Barbie and Ken to the plastic lifestyles of the uber rich in LA. When watching scenes of Barbie & Ken hitting it off, I could see Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce in their place. The production feels like a big Hollywood musical. Large sets with large scale musical numbers. But yet they have an avant garde feel to them, as if it was a Tim Burton film, or maybe a fantasy scene from a Coen brothers movie. The hundreds of props littered throughout the film also provide meaning as they are symbols of the masculine and feminine mystique.Barbie the movie is a surprising existential essay that finds meaning behind the plastic. The script achieves in its quest to draw interest from the average moviegoer by revealing how much of the Barbie world lives within us.",den script save oddbal premis,thi film work it want go goofi seriou moralist sentiment which similar multiton everyth everywher all at onc both movi tri juggl differ tone theme succeed part one thing barbi go favour know limit merci clock le two hour the script explor mani aspect aura barbi doll legaci thi fresh topic alon provid interest insight an origin premis world cookiecutt franchis sequel both posit neg aspect barbi doll repres address without hold back amazingli even mattel corpor lampoon so script allow address le popular characterist doll find real insight barbi ken repres young kid compar matur adult worldbut script normal cant cake eat it lightheart trip barbieland also find true sad give activ imagin get older need seriou real world not deliv straight forward lesson male domin societi woman rare given posit power give credit cowrit director greta gerwig master thing barbi stick blender make cohes piec work transcend expect movi base toy doll give credit power took chanc unlik hit movi keep narr move along engag unpredict waysnot one could make movi actor lead role persona especi physic like margot robbi ryan gosl seem perfect match robbi especi bring heartfelt sad coupl scene make charact one dimension despit base plastic doll gosl bring lightheart person role ken convincingli yet allow one dimension charact wish sen belongingi also realli enjoy script made comparison plastic world barbi ken plastic lifestyl uber rich la when watch scene barbi ken hit i could see taylor swift travi kelc place the product feel like big hollywood music larg set larg scale music number but yet avant gard feel tim burton film mayb fantasi scene coen brother movi the hundr prop litter throughout film also provid mean symbol masculin feminin mystiquebarbi movi surpris existenti essay find mean behind plastic the script achiev quest draw interest averag moviego reveal much barbi world live within u
How Did We Get Here?,"I'm obviously not the right demographic for 'Barbie', but it's hard to avoid the muddled tone & uneven delivery. A fantasy / reality parable of being female with a sprinkle of battle of the sexes. You get two likable leads, but it doesn't have any answers to the problems it's illuminating.""Stereotypical"" Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives in Barbieland filled with all the female variations released over the years. There lives also the wide variety of Ken's including ""Beach"" Ken (Ryan Gosling). When a mother (America Ferrera) experiences negative feelings in the real world while playing with the Barbies of her teen angst daughter it has a transitional effect on this Barbie who takes a trip to reality to sort things out. Ken comes along for the ride & learns how things for men are much different. Barely able to grasp the complexities, he takes a rudimentary form back to Barbieland causing a shift in balance. Meanwhile Mattel CEO (Will Ferrell) becomes aware and tries to correct the problem much like Barbie herself.They acknowledge some of the criticisms thrown at the doll openly over the years - which I don't necessarily agree with - but it was a mature move. I could tell you Margot Robbie is perfectly cast and Ryan Gosling gets all the best lines too. The look of the movie - production design in Barbieland - is on point. It's a bright sphere complete with the toy accessories (houses, car, fake food). Song and dance numbers. Fish out of water scenarios played for laughs.Where this tale falters is tying everything together & a barely hidden undercurrent. The cliche blame game. I give 'Barbie' credit for not going the contrived route of a typical romcom. However it's message & wanting to be a fun flick at the same time yields mixed results.

An Elf-like work of art.,"My husband asked me to compare this to something else to ally, and my first thought was Elf. In these ways it lives up to one of the greatest movies of all time - both are hilarious, have wonderful musical numbers, heartwarming, will make you tear up, complicated parental storylines, unlikely character bonding, and whimsical visual tie-ins/world-building + bonus of both having Will Ferrel to boot.I loved the soundtrack - the Lizzo song being a fun 4th wallesque/narrator-y way to introduce Barbieland.The pace was even - I never felt it was moving too quickly or wanting a scene to wrap up.Some more unexpected show-stealers were Simu Liu and Arianna Greenblatt.The haters are simply mad this is a film that is self-aware and for a new generation.",an elflik work art,my husband ask compar someth el alli first thought elf in way live one greatest movi time hilari wonder music number heartwarm make tear complic parent storylin unlik charact bond whimsic visual tieinsworldbuild bonu will ferrel booti love soundtrack lizzo song fun th wallesquenarratori way introduc barbielandth pace even i never felt move quickli want scene wrap upsom unexpect showsteal simu liu arianna greenblattth hater simpli mad film selfawar new gener
Fantastic production but why did they go trying to make it all introspective,I took my whole family to this movie thinking it was something we all could enjoy at least a little. My two girls are 6 and 8... I realized going in that it's mostly for adults but I wasn't expecting it to be totally for adults given the theme. Too bad. My oldest daughter was so disappointed by it that she was crying after and didn't understand it to be honest - she thought it was going to be more fun because we watched the trailers over and over. I mean it was a fantastic production and a lot of creativity went into making the Barbie world but why did they have to make the Barbie characters so introspective. So much crying and melodramatic parts for a movie that should be geared towards a kids imagination. And why did the ending need to be so lame. I thought at the very list they could have ended it on a fun note for the kids but the ending really sucked for my daughters.,fantast product go tri make introspect,i took whole famili movi think someth could enjoy least littl my two girl i realiz go mostli adult i wasnt expect total adult given theme too bad my oldest daughter disappoint cri didnt understand honest thought go fun watch trailer i mean fantast product lot creativ went make barbi world make barbi charact introspect so much cri melodramat part movi gear toward kid imagin and end need lame i thought list could end fun note kid end realli suck daughter

The music, cast, script and the acting were perfection.Also the character Alan is so underrated. Alan represents all the men that don't take part of the problem. He stands with Barbie even though all the Ken's stood against her.When I saw this movie I could feel all of us were united.

Gerwig and Robbie Introduce a Whole New Generation to Existential Crises,"One sentence summary: Barbie's perfect existence enters a tailspin when she starts contemplating the meaning of life and the possibility of death.A Barbie feature film was always in the cards for Mattel, but I'm not sure anyone other than Greta Gerwig expected it to grapple with such substantial themes. But even with the heavy topics, Barbie is colorful enough, both in its palette and its actors' charisma, to attract a wide variety of audiences. Hence the movie's staggering $1.4 billion box office return. Not every creative decision functioned to the film's benefit, but the project as a whole felt genuine and fluid. The steady stream of comedy, provided primarily by Will Ferrell, the Mattel CEO and the film's main antagonist, also worked nicely to balance the tone and add a bit of levity. While the movie may not be as perfect as Barbie's world, Hollywood couldn't have asked for a more impactful cinematic debut for the iconic children's toy.",gerwig robbi introduc whole new gener existenti crise,one sentenc summari barbi perfect exist enter tailspin start contempl mean life possibl deatha barbi featur film alway card mattel im sure anyon greta gerwig expect grappl substanti theme but even heavi topic barbi color enough palett actor charisma attract wide varieti audienc henc movi stagger billion box offic return not everi creativ decis function film benefit project whole felt genuin fluid the steadi stream comedi provid primarili will ferrel mattel ceo film main antagonist also work nice balanc tone add bit leviti while movi may perfect barbi world hollywood couldnt ask impact cinemat debut icon child toy
"All Things Considered, It's Perfect.","When I first heard about this movie, I didn't want to see it. Then I watched the trailer and my mind was changed instantly. Margot Robbie as Barbie could not have been a better casting choice, Ryan Gosling as Ken was just *chef's kiss*. It's a wonderfully beautiful and talented cast. It's charming, funny, touching, powerful and overall perfect. The soundtrack is fantastic, I've been listening to I'm Just Ken on repeat for days now. The diversity and representation within the cast is beautiful and so exciting to see in a movie as big as this one.

So self-congratulatory,"It's taken me a couple of days to ponder over what I really thought of this movie. That's a plus, in that it really made me think. However the more I think about it, the more turned off I am by the whole thing.Pros: The style is pretty fresh, and I was happy to see an original movie do well at the box office. Ryan Gosling was hilarious and nailed the balance between tongue-in-cheek and taking it super seriously. Simu Liu was great too. Taken by themselves, so many of the scenes were spot-on and funny, but the movie as a whole was just too much. That leads me to the negatives.Cons: Some of the Barbieland kitsch went on for too long and started to give me a headache. In the beginning when that song started up again for perfect day #2, I thought my brain was going to melt. The narrator was funny at first and then got annoying, especially when she started breaking the 4th wall. Some of the monologues (mainly THE monologue) would have read just fine as blog posts or opinion columns. In fact, I'm pretty sure I've read it before. In the movie it started coming across as buzzword-filled lecturing. I cringed whenever Barbie had a feminist lightbulb moment and used the academic-turned-popular jargon. Eventually it was like they were trying to get extra credit for using vocabulary words. Amusing at first, but got old fast.Finally, ironically, I (a mom...a very pregnant mom) went to see this movie with my own mom. For all the different kinds of Barbies out there, one type of identity Barbie isn't allowed to have is Mother. The repeated gag where everyone cringes at Midge, the briefly shown ""pregnant friend"", told me this movie really wasn't for me. The film took pains to show women of almost every description and identity category in positions of power in Barbieland, but the ""mom friend"" was the actual, unironic butt of the joke. I get it, she's an awkward footnote in Barbie history. She DOESN'T fit into the Barbie message as stated in the film. I could've brushed it off as tongue-in-cheek like the rest of the movie, but it went further. That line: ""We mothers stand still so our daughters can see how far they've come""? That shows me where mothers belong in this world. On the sidelines. Forever in the background, just a plot device. Or a joke. If you HAVE to have children, at least relegate yourself to your rightful role as the picture on the wall, history that no one wants to repeat. Even this movie, that satirizes the roles typically played by women in popular media by reversing the role onto Ken, still manages to keep one huge group of women in the-what shall we call it?-Ken-zone.",so selfcongratulatori,it taken coupl day ponder i realli thought movi that plu realli made think howev i think turn i whole thingpro the style pretti fresh i happi see origin movi well box offic ryan gosl hilari nail balanc tongueincheek take super serious simu liu great taken mani scene spoton funni movi whole much that lead negativescon some barbieland kitsch went long start give headach in begin song start perfect day i thought brain go melt the narrat funni first got annoy especi start break th wall some monologu mainli the monologu would read fine blog post opinion column in fact im pretti sure ive read in movi start come across buzzwordfil lectur i cring whenev barbi feminist lightbulb moment use academicturnedpopular jargon eventu like tri get extra credit use vocabulari word amus first got old fastfin iron i moma pregnant mom went see movi mom for differ kind barbi one type ident barbi isnt allow mother the repeat gag everyon cring midg briefli shown pregnant friend told movi realli wasnt the film took pain show woman almost everi descript ident categori posit power barbieland mom friend actual uniron butt joke i get she awkward footnot barbi histori she doesnt fit barbi messag state film i couldv brush tongueincheek like rest movi went that line we mother stand still daughter see far theyv come that show mother belong world on sidelin forev background plot devic or joke if have child least releg right role pictur wall histori one want repeat even movi satir role typic play woman popular medium revers role onto ken still manag keep one huge group woman thewhat shall call itkenzon
Barbie Drama,"The first 30 minutes of ""Barbie"" had me intrigued and entertained. With its colorful world and charming characters,The beginning was fun, light-hearted, and had that nostalgic touch that brought back fond memories.However, as the movie progressed, it took an unexpected turn towards heavy themes of feminine power and patriarchy. While these concepts are important and relevant, they felt out of place in a Barbie movie. The shift in tone became overwhelming and overshadowed the initial enjoyment.I wanted to love this movie, but the burden of tackling such complex ideas seemed misplaced in the Barbie universe. It lost the essence of what makes a Barbie movie special-simple yet heartwarming stories with valuable life lessons. The movie became a bit too preachy and lost its magical charm.In the end, ""Barbie"" had the potential to be a delightful family film, but the weighty themes proved to be too much for a franchise known for its light and cheerful nature. It left me longing for the simple joy and innocent fun that Barbie movies used to bring.",barbi drama,the first minut barbi intrigu entertain with color world charm charactersth begin fun lightheart nostalg touch brought back fond memorieshowev movi progress took unexpect turn toward heavi theme feminin power patriarchi while concept import relev felt place barbi movi the shift tone becam overwhelm overshadow initi enjoymenti want love movi burden tackl complex idea seem misplac barbi univers it lost essenc make barbi movi specialsimpl yet heartwarm stori valuabl life lesson the movi becam bit preachi lost magic charmin end barbi potenti delight famili film weighti theme prove much franchis known light cheer natur it left long simpl joy innoc fun barbi movi use bring

These movie is about existational crisis, finding who you are and your purpose.And they do that amazingly good. In the end you just understand the character and you touched by her story. I cry at the end and I didn't expect that at all. In the end she just discovers that she doesn't need to be Barbie, she can be whoever she wants, this beautiful.

"It is, indeed, a Barbie world","Granted, my experience of Barbie may have been influenced by the fact that I saw it an hour after getting out of Oppenheimer, but I gotta say: I thoroughly enjoyed watching this one in a crowded theater on opening weekend. The degree of difficulty here cannot be overstated. Just making a decent movie about Barbie is tough. Making one that is hilarious and insightful and at points actually touching? That should be impossible, but Gerwig nails it in many ways. Not everything worked for me, but not everything works for me in any comedy. Overall, they told a story about a toy which I have no attachment to (and at points would have described as problematic), and totally sucked me in. And based on the theater's reaction around me, I wasn't alone.",it inde barbi world,grant experi barbi may influenc fact i saw hour get oppenheim i got ta say i thoroughli enjoy watch one crowd theater open weekend the degre difficulti overst just make decent movi barbi tough make one hilari insight point actual touch that imposs gerwig nail mani way not everyth work everyth work comedi overal told stori toy i attach point would describ problemat total suck and base theater reaction around i wasnt alon
I'm so glad I waited until it was released on HBO Max and I can't believe everyone claims it's for adults,"With all the hype about this movie I was really tempted to see it on the big screen. Not for kids, deep and funny? Count me in! I just didn't get around to seeing it and I'm so glad. It would obviously bore young children, but how did it not bore every other adult as well? What a lame comedy-only one scene made me chuckle, the rest of the ""funny"" parts made me roll my eyes. I'd say it's more of a tween movie, or even teen if you keep them under a rock. But I don't know what the excuse is for adults thinking it's an amazing, brilliant comedy. And the whole deep part was pretty lame as soon as we saw that Barbie realized that the real world isn't how it is in hers.",im glad i wait releas hbo max i cant believ everyon claim adult,with hype movi i realli tempt see big screen not kid deep funni count i didnt get around see im glad it would obvious bore young child bore everi adult well what lame comedyonli one scene made chuckl rest funni part made roll eye id say tween movi even teen keep rock but i dont know excus adult think amaz brilliant comedi and whole deep part pretti lame soon saw barbi realiz real world isnt
Babes in toy land.,"'Barbie (2023)' truly is an accomplishment, a shockingly successful blend between a mass-appeal blockbuster and a strange slice of surreal existentialism. There isn't anything quite like it and, although it essentially serves as one giant advertisement for its eponymous doll, it feels like a genuine piece of almost outsider art with a great sense of humour and a ton of heart. It's an incredibly well-crafted feature. The cinematography, set design and costuming all hit the nail squarely on the head, to the point that the pastel plastic aesthetic of Barbieland is so compelling and so complete that it honestly feels as though the movie has become live-action once Barbie and Ken make their way to the real world (even though the flick has been live-action since its first frame). The performances help with this, too, as the actors not only throw themselves from head to toe into the absurdity needed to fully embody the unreal nature of their characters but also deliver their lines with pitch-perfect timing and genuine emotion. All the Barbies and all the Kens (and Allan) are great, but Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling truly are the stars here. The former is absolutely brilliant, nailing the emotional dichotomy of her character's mindset as she undergoes her journey, and the latter just seems as though he's having a great time, living that quintessential Ken lifestyle without an ounce of embarrassment. It's also nice to see Will Ferrell being funny again, popping up as a CEO who seems like he just might be Buddy the Elf all grown up (it's not like he ever stopped being funny, per se, but he's been in some rough movies recently), and America Ferrera is great in her more down-to-Earth yet refreshingly honest role.Although the movie is perhaps a little unfocused at times, its important messaging rings true from beginning to end. It satirises the patriarchy and highlights its inherent ridiculousness without undermining the genuine damage it has caused and continues to cause. It is, at its heart, a wonderfully feminist film. It seems to have been made by women for women, but it's so universally affecting (not to mention fun) that it resonates with everyone in its audience (as a man, I was more than happy to be along for the ride). Furthermore, its potent feminist elements are only slightly dampened by the fact that they have been packaged into a shiny product that's easily digestible by pretty much everyone (save for the whiny babies whose typically toxic masculinity is so fragile it can actually be threatened by this deeply silly yet deeply truthful movie). The picture does pull back slightly in its third act to take a more centrist approach, which does cause this movement to ever-so-slightly lose its way. However, its nuanced take on the material still feels markedly human and, though it takes a (likely studio-mandated) safe route, the flick goes in the right direction. In fact, it arrives at its intended destination mostly unscathed, primarily thanks to its supremely emotionally resonant coda. This is actually a big win for such a big-budget blockbuster; Mattel do pat themselves on the back quite a bit with their exceedingly generous depiction, but they don't seem to have been scared of a little controversy and that's unusual for a company of their size. Using something with such wide appeal to convey feminist ideas is a good way to introduce those ideas to people perhaps unlikely to otherwise seek them out, which arguably justifies the fact that those concepts have to be slightly watered down in this context. It's almost like feminism 101, in a way. Of course, the people who need to hear this stuff the most are already out there burning Barbies at the mere thought of the picture, but those who've perhaps not thought about these things before (perfectly nice but utterly clueless boyfriends, for example) may have learnt something once the credits roll (if they're open-minded enough to allow their perception to be challenged). At the very least, the piece is prompting discussion and will make almost every woman in its audience feel seen in a way they likely haven't by a movie in quite some time.As an aside, I'm not sure how much of the film would work for kids, and it doesn't really seem like they're even part of the intended demographic. Greta Gerwig and co are clearly more interested in unpacking what Barbie represents as a whole than they are in selling new Barbie toys to children and that's okay. Not every piece of branded media needs to cater to the youngest in its audience, and this is potentially a good way to introduce youngsters to feminism and the patriarchy (I'm not a child psychologist or a parent, though, so perhaps take that with a grain of salt).Ultimately, this surrealist satire is an emotional rollercoaster of an experience that's as silly as it is sincere. It's just such a good time. It's delightfully camp and surprisingly profound, centred around some fantastic performances that bring to life a brilliant screenplay under some amazingly assured direction. It's enjoyable, affecting, funny, heartbreaking, poignant, affirming, exciting, absurd, intelligent, important, slightly unsettling and unlike anything else out there. It's actually something of a miracle in its own way. If you tell me you didn't cry when you watched it, I won't believe you.",babe toy land,barbi truli accomplish shockingli success blend massapp blockbust strang slice surreal existenti there isnt anyth quit like although essenti serv one giant advertis eponym doll feel like genuin piec almost outsid art great sen humour ton heart it incred wellcraft featur the cinematographi set design costum hit nail squar head point pastel plastic aesthet barbieland compel complet honestli feel though movi becom liveact barbi ken make way real world even though flick liveact sinc first frame the perform help actor throw head toe absurd need fulli embodi unreal natur charact also deliv line pitchperfect time genuin emot all barbi ken allan great margot robbi ryan gosl truli star the former absolut brilliant nail emot dichotomi charact mindset undergo journey latter seem though he great time live quintessenti ken lifestyl without ounc embarrass it also nice see will ferrel funni pop ceo seem like might buddi elf grown like ever stop funni per se he rough movi recent america ferrera great downtoearth yet refreshingli honest rolealthough movi perhap littl unfocus time import messag ring true begin end it satiris patriarchi highlight inher ridicul without undermin genuin damag caus continu caus it heart wonder feminist film it seem made woman woman univers affect mention fun reson everyon audienc man i happi along ride furthermor potent feminist element slightli dampen fact packag shini product that easili digest pretti much everyon save whini babi whose typic toxic masculin fragil actual threaten deepli silli yet deepli truth movi the pictur pull back slightli third act take centrist approach caus movement eversoslightli lose way howev nuanc take materi still feel markedli human though take like studiomand safe rout flick goe right direct in fact arriv intend destin mostli unscath primarili thank suprem emot reson coda thi actual big win bigbudget blockbust mattel pat back quit bit exceedingli gener depict dont seem scare littl controversi that unusu compani size use someth wide appeal convey feminist idea good way introduc idea peopl perhap unlik otherwis seek arguabl justifi fact concept slightli water context it almost like femin way of cours peopl need hear stuff alreadi burn barbi mere thought pictur whove perhap thought thing perfectli nice utterli clueless boyfriend exampl may learnt someth credit roll theyr openmind enough allow percept challeng at least piec prompt discus make almost everi woman audienc feel seen way like havent movi quit timea asid im sure much film would work kid doesnt realli seem like theyr even part intend demograph greta gerwig co clearli interest unpack barbi repres whole sell new barbi toy child that okay not everi piec brand medium need cater youngest audienc potenti good way introduc youngster femin patriarchi im child psychologist parent though perhap take grain saltultim surrealist satir emot rollercoast experi that silli sincer it good time it delight camp surprisingli profound centr around fantast perform bring life brilliant screenplay amazingli assur direct it enjoy affect funni heartbreak poignant affirm excit absurd intellig import slightli unsettl unlik anyth el it actual someth miracl way if tell didnt cri watch i wont believ
Definitely enjoyable,"I initially thought this movie was this movie was about Barbie finding out that she was a toy, but she actually already knows that! Anyway, this movie was about Barbie getting real emotions and going to the real world to find the girl (revealed to be a grown woman) who's playing with her Barbie toy wrong. There's a halfway plot switch, as the second half is about Ken (well, the Kens) taking over Barbieland and changing it to Kenland. I admit that the second half isn't as good as the first. The movie probably could have been trimmed by twenty minutes and it would have been better. Will Ferrell is in this, but the problem is that he isn't used more.Wait, he was in ""Stranger Than Fiction"", a movie about a guy who found out his life was being controlled by a writer.

There is an art-house movie under all that pink,"I tend to gravitate towards French cinema and the classics; the idea of watching a franchise movie about Barbie seemed mildly repellent at first. Well, I am glad I kept an open mind.This is a riotously funny, zany meta comedy with touches of Wes Anderson and Bollywood; yet also strangely affecting. The idea of giving a plastic doll an existential crisis may seem gimmicky, yet it works. The cracks showing in the perfect façade of the perfect Barbie world are rendered through metaphors that hit the mark, full of a strange melancholia. I am usually put off by sentimentalisms: here, thankfully, they are kept at a bare minimum, even in the ending.Overall, I am astonished this film exists at all. I imagine the authors meeting with a slightly distracted Mattel executive, being given a gazillion of dollars with the vaguest of briefs, and running away with it, to make a film that would send any corporate committee into a tailspin -- I imagine a first projection with the producers fainting and having a heart attack -- yet also make them laugh all the way to the bank. However it happened, chapeau. I am glad I went, I'll buy the dvd as well. I can see myself rewatching it to be sure I got all the micro gags and layers of meaning, but also putting it on when I need a little pick me up.",there arthous movi pink,i tend gravit toward french cinema classic idea watch franchis movi barbi seem mildli repel first well i glad i kept open mindthi riotous funni zani meta comedi touch we anderson bollywood yet also strang affect the idea give plastic doll existenti crisi may seem gimmicki yet work the crack show perfect faad perfect barbi world render metaphor hit mark full strang melancholia i usual put sentiment thank kept bare minimum even endingoveral i astonish film exist i imagin author meet slightli distract mattel execut given gazillion dollar vaguest brief run away make film would send corpor committe tailspin i imagin first project produc faint heart attack yet also make laugh way bank howev happen chapeau i glad i went ill buy dvd well i see rewatch sure i got micro gag layer mean also put i need littl pick
"Good, clean summer fun","Really didn't know what to make of ""Barbie"", given the marketing, so it was never really on my radar. But eventually, my kid goes on about it at length and the cultural fervor starts getting the the ol' curiosity piqued. So, here we are ...And it delivers; I think it's a fun movie with great dance numbers, phenomenal sets and excellent performances from both Robbie and Gosling. I love the use of practical effects in creating a living playset, and most of the jokes at Mattel's expense land pretty well.The most common criticism I've heard is that it's preachy; and maybe it is. All I can say for certain is that it spoke to everyone in my household (we're all feminists here). We can probably all agree it is a lot better than a Mattel movie has any right to be and honestly, Margot Robbie is fantastic.",good clean summer fun,realli didnt know make barbi given market never realli radar but eventu kid goe length cultur fervor start get ol curio piqu so and deliv i think fun movi great danc number phenomen set excel perform robbi gosl i love use practic effect creat live playset joke mattel expens land pretti wellth common critic ive heard preachi mayb all i say certain spoke everyon household feminist we probabl agre lot better mattel movi right honestli margot robbi fantast
Loved everything about it,"I think Barbie has always been about women empowerment and I'm glad there's a Barbie movie that doesn't tiptoe around it to spare feelings. This movie was not marketed towards kids, it was clearly meant for adults who grew up with Barbie. It's an important message and it was told well. The cinematography was also incredible. Loved the costumes, the casting, everything about it. Margot played a literal perfect Barbie. I loved the scene where she was supposed to be ""ugly"" and the narrator made a joke about Margot being the wrong person to cast if you wanted to make an ugly scene with her. Ryan gosling also have an amazing performance as Ken. Even when he was being a douche he still came across lovable.",love everyth,i think barbi alway woman empower im glad there barbi movi doesnt tipto around spare feel thi movi market toward kid clearli meant adult grew barbi it import messag told well the cinematographi also incred love costum cast everyth margot play liter perfect barbi i love scene suppos ugli narrat made joke margot wrong person cast want make ugli scene ryan gosl also amaz perform ken even douch still came across lovabl
Not as good as I hoped,"Like many, I saw the ads and read the hype surrounding this movie. And who would walk away from the perfect summer time movie that features Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling? I mean just based on curiosty alone, what would a movie about a child's doll be about? So off to the movies we went. And after the first 2 minutes, I was already having a bad feeling about this one.....and I really wanted to like it. As expected, much of the movie happens in BarbieLand, a perfect little beach front community where everyone cherishes Barbie. Lots of singing and dancing, colorful scenery, character introductions and so forth. You wonder where the story is going and out of the blue comes the theme of death. So at this point, its no longer a kids movie IMO. And the story developes into Barbie's mission to cross in to the real world to save the person who's not happy with their Barbie doll. And by not happy, I mean depressed with thoughts of death. A pretty dark twist. So the mission begins with Ken and Barbie visiting LA. The story becomes a mix of several themes including female enpowerment, corporate greed and a push for a male dominated society. Although I chuckled a couple times, this movie never sucked me into the story to the point where I felt I wasnt in a theater, if you know what I mean. In fact, it felt like every 15 minutes I was hoping the movie was over. Margot and Ryan give outstanding performances, but the novelty of Barbieland quickly wears off, leaving the audience blasted with bubblegum pop music and watching Barbie disolve into an emotional trainwreck as she faces a personal identity chrisis. Of course, this becomes the stories message to tweens, that life's hard, its OK to fail and finding strength to succeed isnt easy, regardless of gender. Its an awkward movie in that it doesnt really fit for kids or adults, unless you ignore the story and just look at the pictures.",not good i hope,like mani i saw ad read hype surround movi and would walk away perfect summer time movi featur margot robbi ryan gosl i mean base curiosti alon would movi child doll so movi went and first minut i alreadi bad feel oneand i realli want like a expect much movi happen barbieland perfect littl beach front commun everyon cherish barbi lot sing danc color sceneri charact introduct forth you wonder stori go blue come theme death so point longer kid movi imo and stori develop barbi mission cross real world save person who happi barbi doll and happi i mean depress thought death a pretti dark twist so mission begin ken barbi visit la the stori becom mix sever theme includ femal enpower corpor greed push male domin societi although i chuckl coupl time movi never suck stori point i felt i wasnt theater know i mean in fact felt like everi minut i hope movi margot ryan give outstand perform novelti barbieland quickli wear leav audienc blast bubblegum pop music watch barbi disolv emot trainwreck face person ident chrisi of cours becom stori messag tween life hard ok fail find strength succeed isnt easi regardless gender it awkward movi doesnt realli fit kid adult unless ignor stori look pictur
Beautiful set design,"I loved Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken. The set of Barbie land was supper cool - all pink and plastic - as good as a live action Barbie film can get.All the writers had to do is come up with a cute story and this movie would have been a classic. Instead they decided to make a dark and depressing movie and disappoint everyone.The film was very heavily promoted - ads were everywhere. I could tell from the trailer that I may be a bit weird, but I still went to see it hoping that it won't be too bad. Well - it wasn't just bad, it was terrible.Barbie has thoughts of death and cellulite. I'm shocked Mattel was ok with this.The writers are not even subtle about their message. I felt bad for all parents who took their kids to see what they believed to be a movie about and doll. I felt bad for all guys who sat there listening to the writers say over and over again how bad the patriarchy is.Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse America Ferrera started her awful monologue about female oppression.

Healing my 80's childhood heart,"I laughed and cried all the way through this movie as my 80's child heart healed and my midlife heart felt reassured that how I have felt through all these years is has been seen. Greta Gerwig is a genius and I'm sorry for all those who thought this was going to be some plastic-fantastic fun ride and were stuck with the deep existentialism and down with the patriarchy messaging - but this was a masterpiece!

I GOT IT BUT I DIDN'T LOVE IT...SORRY...!,"The biggest film of the year (both in box office & critical praise) starring Oscar nominee Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling. Opening on the conceit that Barbies live a charmed existence in a sequestered pink plastered village of their own w/their Ken counterparts sharing in the glory as they go forward in their day to day duties. Robbie is the nominal center of attention who suddenly gets pangs of an existential dilemma which prompts her & Gosling, who has stowaway'd in her car, as she heads to the real world to get some answers. Reaching there, Robbie finds the axis of her feelings are coming from a Mattel employee, America Ferrara & to a certain extent her daughter, Ariana Greenblatt, but Robbie doesn't count on pesky Gosling to reach his own sense of male patterned nirvana as he gleans the real world moves along a patriarchal arc which he takes back home to remake their world in his own image which starts to affect real world Barbie products (Ken dolls are becoming more prominent) but more importantly Robbie & the rest of her Barbie compatriots standing in their own home turf. A great conceit to be sure which for me left me in a state of nonplussed-itude since I never played w/the dolls growing up & for all the people which were affected by this smart take on a piece of plastic from Oscar nominated co-writer/director Greta Gerwig, I salute you but I wish I loved it more or at all but something like this can only affect someone if they're willing to accept it which sadly but gladly I may be in the minority of.",i got it but i didnt love itsorri,the biggest film year box offic critic prais star oscar nomine margot robbi ryan gosl open conceit barbi live charm exist sequest pink plaster villag wtheir ken counterpart share glori go forward day day duti robbi nomin center attent suddenli get pang existenti dilemma prompt gosl stowawayd car head real world get answer reach robbi find axi feel come mattel employe america ferrara certain extent daughter ariana greenblatt robbi doesnt count peski gosl reach sen male pattern nirvana glean real world move along patriarch arc take back home remak world imag start affect real world barbi product ken doll becom promin importantli robbi rest barbi compatriot stand home turf a great conceit sure left state nonplusseditud sinc i never play wthe doll grow peopl affect smart take piec plastic oscar nomin cowriterdirector greta gerwig i salut i wish i love someth like affect someon theyr will accept sadli gladli i may minor
This movie was so mediocre I had to write a review...,"This is quite possibly the most overhyped movie ever. The plot is forgettable and a-lot of the films plot points contradict the overarching themes. Barbie was horrified by the patriarchal society in the real world however when she came back she helped create a matriarchy by appointing all positions of leadership to barbies and refusing to let kens sit on the senate. The ken's were objectified throughout the movie not being given any validation but when they took over barbie threw a tantrum and refused to sympathise with them. Also the barbie's had no objection to the ken's instilling a patriarchy and rolled over immediately conforming to their rules without a second thought. They were meant to be these strong feminist characters but they did not have a mind of their own and it took the monologue of a side character's superficial problems to bring them to their senses. These issues take away from the meaning of the film and overall the idea was executed poorly. The movie has some plus points, being an partially enjoyable comedy but is not worthy of the 8* ratings. An excruciatingly mind numbing movie with some moments of laughter, wait for this one to release on DVD or streaming platforms.",thi movi mediocr i write review,thi quit possibl overhyp movi ever the plot forgett alot film plot point contradict overarch theme barbi horrifi patriarch societi real world howev came back help creat matriarchi appoint posit leadership barbi refus let ken sit senat the ken objectifi throughout movi given valid took barbi threw tantrum refus sympathis also barbi object ken instil patriarchi roll immedi conform rule without second thought they meant strong feminist charact mind took monologu side charact superfici problem bring sen these issu take away mean film overal idea execut poorli the movi plu point partial enjoy comedi worthi rate an excruciatingli mind numb movi moment laughter wait one releas dvd stream platform
The resurrection of the Barbie franchise and a philosophical existential and social reflection,"Barbie's first live action movie revives the name of the toy franchise created by Mattel that after many years seemed to be forgotten along with other titles like Max Steel. This film manages to revive this franchise by presenting us with a magical world made up of many of the versions of Barbie and Ken that have been made throughout history. Barbieland recreates many of the elements and characteristics of the toys that marked the childhood of many girls. The movie is quite colorful, cartoony and wacky, with a rather childish goofiness and cartoonish humor that can if it can make some people cringe. She has all the femininity that has always characterized the Barbie franchise and becomes feminine enough to respect the vision of the franchise, while adapting to current times. Margot Robbie is very charismatic in her role as Barbie and Ryan Gosling manages to play a very nice Ken.As Barbie and Ken begin their great adventure into the real world, the film begins to gradually turn deep and philosophical, raising existential and social questions. In Barbieland everything is happiness and a dream land, but the real world is the opposite, this being a symbolism about discovering that reality is not as one imagines or dreams. Topics such as paradigm shifts, gender roles and human identity beyond being a man or a woman are also touched on. Barbie comes to question a lot about what her purpose is and Ken feels so isolated that he tries to be much more in a world where Barbies have had everything in their hands. The fundamental message that this film ends up being the human identity that exists beyond being a man or a woman, whose purpose is only defined by what society or social groups dictate. Barbie is clearly a movie that can generate different interpretations, that some will see it in a positive or negative way, but that makes it very clear the true and only message that this movie has and it is like the ideologies or positions implemented by society or groups Social networks have created a division about what to be or what to be, ignoring human identity. It not only questions right-wing ideas, but also left-wing ideas at the same time in the form of satire. In conclusion, Barbie is not only a film that gloriously revives the franchise and awakens some nostalgia in those who played with the toys or grew up with the animated films, it is a philosophical work on how society itself implants ideas or illusions that They make us forget our identity as human beings and who we really are, questioning our very existence. My final rating for this movie is 9/10.",the resurrect barbi franchis philosoph existenti social reflect,barbi first live action movi reviv name toy franchis creat mattel mani year seem forgotten along titl like max steel thi film manag reviv franchis present u magic world made mani version barbi ken made throughout histori barbieland recreat mani element characterist toy mark childhood mani girl the movi quit color cartooni wacki rather childish goofi cartoonish humor make peopl cring she feminin alway character barbi franchis becom feminin enough respect vision franchis adapt current time margot robbi charismat role barbi ryan gosl manag play nice kena barbi ken begin great adventur real world film begin gradual turn deep philosoph rais existenti social question in barbieland everyth happi dream land real world opposit symbol discov realiti one imagin dream topic paradigm shift gender role human ident beyond man woman also touch barbi come question lot purpos ken feel isol tri much world barbi everyth hand the fundament messag film end human ident exist beyond man woman whose purpos defin societi social group dictat barbi clearli movi gener differ interpret see posit neg way make clear true messag movi like ideolog posit implement societi group social network creat divis ignor human ident it question rightw idea also leftw idea time form satir in conclus barbi film glorious reviv franchis awaken nostalgia play toy grew anim film philosoph work societi implant idea illus they make u forget ident human be realli question exist my final rate movi
The mainstream doll with not such a mainstream film,"I finally plucked up the courage and wore my usual all black clothes as I braved the hordes of pink wearing women to watch Barbie the latest release from director Great Gerwig. The film opens with a voice over from Helen Mirren telling us how Barbie changed the doll business, no longer did young girls just have dolls that were encouraging them to stay in the kitchen now they had barbie who could have any career with the change of an outfit. Straight away this should tell you about the gender politics of this film but more on that later. We then cut to Barbieland where everything is plastic and fantastic that is until one day Barbie out loud says do you ever think about death? (Is there not a therapist barbie?). From there starts an adventure where Barbie and Ken travel to the real world, barbie in search of her owner to find the source of her new found depressive thoughts and Ken well in search of Barbies heart.This film is a hard one to unpick as it's just chaos, there's so much going on all the time, so much so that the slower moments act as nice breathers for the audience. There's dance sequences, action sequences, jokes, gender politics and somewhere in here there's the typical Barbie plot that you might presume this film would have but it's covered with loads of other stuff. The thing I'm most torn on with this film is that I want to praise Gerwig for creating a Barbie film that no one would have predicted while at the same time I can't help wondering if I personally would have enjoyed it more had it been more generic. I'm always talking about how films should be more creative and yet this is the question this film has me asking myself. It's just different and it definitely isn't a kids film, a young girl sat a couple of rows behind me had to keep asking her mum what was going on and I don't blame her as if I was 6,7,8 years old I wouldn't have had a clue. This film seems to be aimed at women Greta's age which is a surprise to me as I thought she was in her late twenties for some reason but you can Google her actual age if you wish to know. Now I know her actual age some of the more older niche references to bands and films etc make more sense and I think it's women that are a similar age to her that she's trying to appeal to here.That brings me onto the films central theming which is its gender politics. It's a film that's about women and for women and in that it does a great job, I think for its target audience it could be an impactful and empowering piece of art. That being said however if you're a pre teen girl or a man you might not get the full emotional impact of this film and I feel that's a bit of a missed opportunity. If this film had eased up on the gender politics at times I think it could have appealed to a wider audience and in doing so may have been able to spread the films message further but I think it's largely ended up falling on death ears to those who aren't in its target audience. It's a shame because the film has an important message to share about equality but it's one that men need to get onboard with as much as women to bring about any real change.By the way, for a film that's supposed to be telling women to be who they are and challenge the patriarchy why has a trend been created for women to wear pink to this film considering it's one of the most commonly associated colours with women?Overall I'm not the target audience for this film but I had a good time nonetheless, it's not one I'll be hurrying back too with haste though.",the mainstream doll mainstream film,i final pluck courag wore usual black cloth i brave hord pink wear woman watch barbi latest releas director great gerwig the film open voic helen mirren tell u barbi chang doll busi longer young girl doll encourag stay kitchen barbi could career chang outfit straight away tell gender polit film later we cut barbieland everyth plastic fantast one day barbi loud say ever think death is therapist barbi from start adventur barbi ken travel real world barbi search owner find sourc new found depress thought ken well search barbi heartthi film hard one unpick chao there much go time much slower moment act nice breather audienc there danc sequenc action sequenc joke gender polit somewher there typic barbi plot might presum film would cover load stuff the thing im torn film i want prais gerwig creat barbi film one would predict time i cant help wonder i person would enjoy gener im alway talk film creativ yet question film ask it differ definit isnt kid film young girl sat coupl row behind keep ask mum go i dont blame i year old i wouldnt clue thi film seem aim woman greta age surpris i thought late twenti reason googl actual age wish know now i know actual age older nich refer band film etc make sen i think woman similar age she tri appeal herethat bring onto film central theme gender polit it film that woman woman great job i think target audienc could impact empow piec art that said howev your pre teen girl man might get full emot impact film i feel that bit miss opportun if film ea gender polit time i think could appeal wider audienc may abl spread film messag i think larg end fall death ear arent target audienc it shame film import messag share equal one men need get onboard much woman bring real changebi way film that suppos tell woman challeng patriarchi trend creat woman wear pink film consid one commonli associ colour womenoveral im target audienc film i good time nonetheless one ill hurri back hast though

Still don't really know what to think of this movie,"I watched this movie a couple of days ago. I didn't really know what to think of it and even after a few days of gentle reflection I haven't been able to draw a definite conclusion.It is quite silly, over the top, laughable, ridiculous, cute and charming on the one hand. On the other hand it does have a deeper message and a good one as well.Because it the story is so over the top and quite hysterical, it really shows you well how conservative en patriarchic standards are still dictating our society. Maybe it needs to be portrayed in such a maner to wake us up. The mirror is funny, but harsh at the same time.Some friends are a huge fan ans some are definitely not. I am somewhat in the middle, but am still ruminating.",still dont realli know think movi,i watch movi coupl day ago i didnt realli know think even day gentl reflect i havent abl draw definit conclusionit quit silli top laughabl ridicul cute charm one hand on hand deeper messag good one wellbecaus stori top quit hyster realli show well conserv en patriarch standard still dictat societi mayb need portray maner wake u the mirror funni harsh timesom friend huge fan an definit i somewhat middl still rumin
"Drop the kids at Oppenheimer the adults can see a real, philosophical masterpiece","I'm not someone who often watches comedies, so they don't make me laugh much, but if they all became as funny as Barbie, I might give it another go.Because I really laughed out loud during the film.It did away perfectly with the comedy and the moralizing, a bit deeper, philosophical stuff.Of course, the soundtrack is top-notch, the sets are breathtaking and there's Ryan Gosling: the main reason I came.In addition to all that, this film is a good critic of patriarchal rule, without overdoing it. It questions gender roles in a fluid way, and brings existential questions to the fore.By the way, I don't understand the opinions of those who didn't like the film because it promoted feminism. Whereas Barbie is literally an invention designed to make women feel as important as men in society, to break down stereotypes and glorify gender equality.Ok whatever, go and see it, it's worth it.",drop kid oppenheim adult see real philosoph masterpiec,im someon often watch comedi dont make laugh much becam funni barbi i might give anoth gobecaus i realli laugh loud filmit away perfectli comedi moral bit deeper philosoph stuffof cours soundtrack topnotch set breathtak there ryan gosl main reason i camein addit film good critic patriarch rule without overdo it question gender role fluid way bring existenti question forebi way i dont understand opinion didnt like film promot femin wherea barbi liter invent design make woman feel import men societi break stereotyp glorifi gender equalityok whatev go see worth
"So Deep, I am Surprised😁","Barbenheimer? Who is the winner? Actually, when I thought about it, their are two completely different movies. Both of them are great, I will tell you why this movie is great, but the main point is that you can't just compare this two movies. Anyway, Greta Gerwig did an absolutely amazing job, and I was so surprised over how deep and emotional this movie really was. This is not made for kids, even if you could think this would be for kids, but no. Some sexual humor and a very complex moral that not every child would understand. The good things about Barbie is the valuable moral itself. They show you that the world and humanity, isn't perfect, and it is never going to be perfect, you just have to focus on how you are now. They showed how women were treated in centuries, and the big pressure on men and how they have to be in front of women, strong, reckless and to never show their feelings. That is something I wouldn't expect from this movie, I was very surprised, and the representation of men, Ken (Just Ken) as the main Ken played be Ryan Gosling, he did just an amazing job at showing how men are and their behaviour. Margot Robbie was the second big star, or the first, both of them were amazing, but she played with such a feeling and emotion. When Barbie, the main Barbie played by Margot, discovered that the world and the people in the world are not perfect, and that not everyone are like her, she was completely off. Margot Robbie showed that feeling in the exactly good way as it should be showed in. Besides the actors, the storytelling, scenography and music soundtrack was amazing. Sometimes it was a bit too much screaming, but that's not the point, this movie was awesome! This is a movie for everyone. If you like Barbie, this movie is for you, if you don't like Barbie, this movie is for you. This is a movie made for everyone, everyone can enjoy it, and I can't really understand why so many countries made this movie forbidden. This movie offers you so much moral, entertainment, and I think this was a great movie.",so deep i surpris,barbenheim who winner actual i thought two complet differ movi both great i tell movi great main point cant compar two movi anyway greta gerwig absolut amaz job i surpris deep emot movi realli thi made kid even could think would kid some sexual humor complex moral everi child would understand the good thing barbi valuabl moral they show world human isnt perfect never go perfect focu they show woman treat centuri big pressur men front woman strong reckless never show feel that someth i wouldnt expect movi i surpris represent men ken just ken main ken play ryan gosl amaz job show men behaviour margot robbi second big star first amaz play feel emot when barbi main barbi play margot discov world peopl world perfect everyon like complet margot robbi show feel exactli good way show besid actor storytel scenographi music soundtrack amaz sometim bit much scream that point movi awesom thi movi everyon if like barbi movi dont like barbi movi thi movi made everyon everyon enjoy i cant realli understand mani countri made movi forbidden thi movi offer much moral entertain i think great movi
Fun but too heavy handed,"The movie is entertaining, most often when it just embraces the absurdity of the doll world. However, the feminist messaging is so heavy handed it feels like parody most of the time. Ken discovering the patriarchy was amusing but the joke goes too far, and again the only way I can describe it is that the message feels like a parody of itself, but you can tell that it's meant to be taken seriously.I still think the movie is fun and genuinely amusing in places. But the most I enjoyed it was when we were with the Kens which I feel is a misfire in Barbie's movie.I almost wish they had just made a comedic film, set mostly in Barbieland, and left the human characters out.I admire what they tried to do, but the tones of the silly Barbie movie and the critique of society segments didn't mesh well.",fun heavi hand,the movi entertain often embrac absurd doll world howev feminist messag heavi hand feel like parodi time ken discov patriarchi amus joke goe far way i describ messag feel like parodi tell meant taken seriouslyi still think movi fun genuin amus place but i enjoy ken i feel misfir barbi moviei almost wish made comed film set mostli barbieland left human charact outi admir tri tone silli barbi movi critiqu societi segment didnt mesh well
Seriously campy fun!,"I must admit, growing up I've had complicated feelings toward Barbie. In the beginning she was fun (my favorite was one of the mermaid Barbies), but growing up I distanced myself from the pink toy. It was no surprise I wasn't excited about the movie until I heard Greta was involved.This movie is exactly what I would want from a Barbie movie. It's extremely campy throughout, but also recognizes that life is very much complicated. It's not easy being an adult woman or man. Do you want to laugh? Watch this movie.

"Pleasantly surprised, but maybe it's a bit too much","I went to see this movie without even seeing the trailer first. I'm a 42 yo man and people kept posting stuff about this movie on social media, so when a friend asked me to go watch it, I said yes...I was expecting some kind of dumb movie, but this is not. It appeals to teenagers but also to an older audience. I loved the sense of humor, Mattel was sometimes laughing at themselves too. I found that very nicely done. The acting is amazing. However I liked the first part of the movie more than the second one. It starts to analyze the patriarchy a bit too heavily for my taste. They want to make it clear that this is a feminist movie. They want to clear Barbie's image of the stereotypes she's been associated with for decades: she's not a blonde and skinny perfect bimbo girl. Barbie is a feminist, she represents empowered women.

"Two hours of ""okay""","I think perhaps my feelings about this movie were negatively affected by all of the marketing and reviewer hype; I expected a great movie, and what I watched was ""okay.""Firstly, the cinematography has a very 90s quirkiness to it. I immediately thought ""Tank Girl,"" and not in a good way. It's an anachronistic aesthetic, honestly.Many of the scenes are a tad long, overstaying their welcome. The script and movie overall could've used another round of revision and editing, to take out 30 minutes of unnecessary dialogue.If you told me that Greta Gerwig was playing with Barbies one day on the floor, and everything she made the dolls say while playing she then wrote down and it verbatim became the script, I'd believe you.The overall message of the movie is delivered by the characters in ham-fisted monologues. Now, if the subject was something we've probably never heard of, like the sci-fi concepts in Inception and the Matrix, a stilted monologue feels awkward, but necessary.But the plight of women in a male hegemony is such a ubiquitous subject, so well known, that to deliver speeches with such zero dramatic subtlety makes me think the movie is better suited for preteens who are only just learning these things.It's trite, in short.There are many ridiculous, light scenes mixed with heavy, emotional poignant scenes. And that's fine, that works-- except the transition between those scenes is ungraceful, to the detriment of both types.The Ken dance scene is fabulous.Several of the jokes and physical comedy were HILARIOUS, but several of them fell pretty flat.I really liked Lady Bird. And I know that this movie is very different in tone; I expected that. I like weird stuff, that's not the issue.This movie's execution feels kind of sophomoric to me, like they thought it was enough that it was a kooky idea, and thus didn't need to apply any editorial rigor that you'd expect in a contemporary movie.",two hour okay,i think perhap feel movi neg affect market review hype i expect great movi i watch okayfirstli cinematographi quirki i immedi thought tank girl good way it anachronist aesthet honestlymani scene tad long overstay welcom the script movi overal couldv use anoth round revis edit take minut unnecessari dialogueif told greta gerwig play barbi one day floor everyth made doll say play wrote verbatim becam script id believ youth overal messag movi deliv charact hamfist monologu now subject someth weve probabl never heard like scifi concept incept matrix stilt monologu feel awkward necessarybut plight woman male hegemoni ubiquit subject well known deliv speech zero dramat subtleti make think movi better suit preteen learn thingsit trite shortther mani ridicul light scene mix heavi emot poignant scene and that fine work except transit scene ungrac detriment typesth ken danc scene fabuloussever joke physic comedi hilari sever fell pretti flati realli like ladi bird and i know movi differ tone i expect i like weird stuff that issuethi movi execut feel kind sophomor like thought enough kooki idea thu didnt need appli editori rigor youd expect contemporari movi
Greta Gerwig Masterpiece,"A fun and clever enough comedy and twist on the world's most famous doll with wonderful production values, a charming Margot Robbie and an absolute hilarious Ryan Gosling.Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before.Cinematography is great here, Set pieces are outstanding and the Soundtrack is a masterpiece.I want to take a minute to take about Greta Gerwig she is so clever and talented hope this movie will push her to direct big blockbuster movies that she deserves.",greta gerwig masterpiec,a fun clever enough comedi twist world famou doll wonder product valu charm margot robbi absolut hilari ryan goslingultim barbi mani thing stereotyp toy idea vessel imagin cultur relic but gerwig trust hand barbi like youv never seen beforecinematographi great set piec outstand soundtrack masterpiecei want take minut take greta gerwig clever talent hope movi push direct big blockbust movi deserv

Brilliant film that showcases womanhood perfectly,"Barbie blew my expectations away. I have never seen such a brilliantly written movie that makes me want to immediately rewatch. Every detail was thought of in Barbie's world and the satire of the Ken's and patriarchal society was hilarious and relatable as a woman. The dialogue was perfectly childish (as if children were playing with the barbie's speaking) and intelligent. America Ferrara's monologue about the hardships of being a woman was spot on and every woman in the theater could relate. The movie was fun and heartfelt while also drawing attention to society's imperfections. Men who say this film isn't good or ""anti-man"", is part of the problem.",brilliant film showcas womanhood perfectli,barbi blew expect away i never seen brilliantli written movi make want immedi rewatch everi detail thought barbi world satir ken patriarch societi hilari relat woman the dialogu perfectli childish child play barbi speak intellig america ferrara monologu hardship woman spot everi woman theater could relat the movi fun heartfelt also draw attent societi imperfect men say film isnt good antiman part problem
"Forget the advertising, it's a Barbie movie.","With exagerated colors as promised, Greta Gerwig shows hers capacity to create a piece that's not like a bait for critics or those who love art cinema, but a commercial movie as deep as its's neccessary for it's time - except for it's publicity and public attraction. Besides it's reputed director, screenwriters, actors, references for great movies and the most popular artists composing it's soundtrack, the movie doesn't crave to be one masterpiece. Its just a regular movie that fulfills its role. Even with some metalanguage and self commentaries, it doesn't reach a self-awareness that makes this worthiest. The same works for it's social commentaries, that use strong words on the dialogues only to cover it's weakness of some social-revolutionary statement of it's own ideology. But that's ok and not something to demand on a dolls movie, right? Tho, the movie still have some high points like it's dinamicity, comedy, sensibility and editing. It will probably won, deservedly, the Oscar for best costume design. It's worthy what it's supposed to worth. It isn't what it selled it was supposed to worth.

La Vie en Rose,"I'm not one of those people who feel the need to apologize for watching 'Barbie'. In my opinion there are no bad movie genres, there are only good movies and bad movies. And the cinema is also popular entertainment, and buying a big bowl of popcorn and sitting in the air-conditioned theater to watch a musical comedy that features some of the most talented actors of the moment can't be the worst thing on a hot summer day. 'Barbie', Greta Gerwig's film did not make me regret the decision to watch it for at least three quarters of its duration.Barbie lives in an ideal world called Barbieland. Actually, I should use the plural, but I don't really know how, because it's not just about the blonde doll we all know, but about all the incarnations she has received over the decades - blondes and brunettes, with white, yellow, black or other skin colors, thinner or bigger. The multiple Barbies have the most diverse professions, from doctor to Nobel laureate writer, from astronaut to president of the United States. Ultimately, the Barbie universe was imagined to give courage and self-confidence to little girls and instill in them the idea that anything is possible. There are also boys, they are generally called Ken, but their purpose is to be the Barbies' (asexual) partners when those are willing to pay attention to them. The introduction to the film is excellent, with a quote from Kubrick's 'A Space Odyssey' and voiceovers narrated by Helen Mirren. When stereotypical blonde Barbie starts getting into trouble, the source is in the real world. Barbie must face reality and the conflict between universes is inevitable. The real world is not like the ideal world and the mixture of them will cause a revolution in Barbieland that will not necessarily be in the right direction. The awakening to reality or, if you will, the humanization of Barbie comes at a price.'Barbie' - the movie works well most of the time, especially when the focus is on the comedic and musical side and the message is integrated into the entertainment. The production is excellent. The sets, the costumes, the cinematography will surely receive Academy Awards nominations, and in some categories 'Barbie' may be the winner. The soundtrack reminds at some points fragments from the history of the pop and ballad genres of the 70s and 80s. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are excellent in the lead roles and I wouldn't be surprised if Barbie dolls borrow their faces (if they haven't already). The messages are well-punched and come across the screen quite well - genuine and fake feminism and the way Barbie products reflect society's conception of the place, role and appearance of women, the more or less camouflaged misogyny of contemporary society, corporations with their seemingly socially aligned messages camouflaging capitalist greed. All of this is well dosed and combined with what happens on screen until the final part of the film, when either the writers took themselves a little too seriously, or they did not have enough inspiration and instead of continuing to infuse the dissolved messages into entertainment they resorted to rhetoric and created an ending that I found forced and didactic. 'Barbie' was worth seeing for the fun part, for the colours, music and humour. When playing with dolls it is good not to be overly serious.",la vie en rose,im one peopl feel need apolog watch barbi in opinion bad movi genr good movi bad movi and cinema also popular entertain buy big bowl popcorn sit aircondit theater watch music comedi featur talent actor moment cant worst thing hot summer day barbi greta gerwig film make regret decis watch least three quarter durationbarbi live ideal world call barbieland actual i use plural i dont realli know blond doll know incarn receiv decad blond brunett white yellow black skin color thinner bigger the multipl barbi diver profess doctor nobel laureat writer astronaut presid unit state ultim barbi univers imagin give courag selfconfid littl girl instil idea anyth possibl there also boy gener call ken purpos barbi asexu partner will pay attent the introduct film excel quot kubrick a space odyssey voiceov narrat helen mirren when stereotyp blond barbi start get troubl sourc real world barbi must face realiti conflict univers inevit the real world like ideal world mixtur caus revolut barbieland necessarili right direct the awaken realiti human barbi come pricebarbi movi work well time especi focu comed music side messag integr entertain the product excel the set costum cinematographi sure receiv academi award nomin categori barbi may winner the soundtrack remind point fragment histori pop ballad genr margot robbi ryan gosl excel lead role i wouldnt surpris barbi doll borrow face havent alreadi the messag wellpunch come across screen quit well genuin fake femin way barbi product reflect societi concept place role appear woman le camouflag misogyni contemporari societi corpor seemingli social align messag camouflag capitalist greed all well dose combin happen screen final part film either writer took littl serious enough inspir instead continu infus dissolv messag entertain resort rhetor creat end i found forc didact barbi worth see fun part colour music humour when play doll good overli seriou
Better than I thought.,"Whilst not being a particular fan of (overly kooky) writer/actor/director Greta Gerwig or the recent efforts of her husband and Co writer Noah Bambaugh, this surprised me as a sharp and hugely enjoyable Toy Story/Trueman Show mash up, that will appeal to most families.Margot Robbie is excellent in the lead, much better than the over caffeine performance she gave in Babylon this year, she shows great heart and soul with good comic timing.As does Ryan Gosling, who like Colin Farrell can actually do comedy. He isn't afraid of showing himself up.It's well written and has something to say. It's also well shot and designed.Even Will Ferrell is good, though he's in a supporting role, so that helps!Out of all the summer blockbusters this year, this is the winner- and yes it's better than Oppenheimer!I could watch it again, something I couldn't do with aforementioned film.",better i thought,whilst particular fan overli kooki writeractordirector greta gerwig recent effort husband co writer noah bambaugh surpris sharp huge enjoy toy storytrueman show mash appeal familiesmargot robbi excel lead much better caffein perform gave babylon year show great heart soul good comic timinga ryan gosl like colin farrel actual comedi he isnt afraid show upit well written someth say it also well shot designedeven will ferrel good though he support role helpsout summer blockbust year winner ye better oppenheimeri could watch someth i couldnt aforement film
Well made but hypocritical,"The movie is very well produced in terms of art. The costumes are beautiful, such as the scenarios. When it comes to give us the impression of a ""toy world"", I give them a 10. Everything was very well thought out. The music scenes were also really good.However, the story is weak. It is kind of a cliche, to be honest: you have a good start, you face a problem, you can't solve it at first, but with your friends help everything is figured out and ends fine. Will Ferrell whole participation, for example, is so... Strange. It seems like he is going to be an important part of the film, but suddenly he and his crew disappear and only return in the end of the movie for a, again, end cliche.Also, they try to force on, like, ""We are so deconstructed, open-heart, unmaterialistic, look how the world is sexist, look how women are underprivileged, look how Mattel is toxic"", but at the same time they are contributing for everything they are, supposedly, criticizing since they work for Hollywood and they have a contract with Mattel.Barbie was not in the news for a long time. Don't you think Mattel is going to sell new dolls like never before after this movie?It's something like ""I'm criticizing you while working for you, so this will promote us, give us money, since my bad comments throughout the movie won't harm you at all"".",well made hypocrit,the movi well produc term art the costum beauti scenario when come give u impress toy world i give everyth well thought the music scene also realli goodhowev stori weak it kind clich honest good start face problem cant solv first friend help everyth figur end fine will ferrel whole particip exampl strang it seem like go import part film suddenli crew disappear return end movi end clichealso tri forc like we deconstruct openheart unmaterialist look world sexist look woman underprivileg look mattel toxic time contribut everyth supposedli critic sinc work hollywood contract mattelbarbi news long time dont think mattel go sell new doll like never movieit someth like im critic work promot u give u money sinc bad comment throughout movi wont harm
Pure marketing hype...that's about it,"I always knew Barbie was going to be hit and miss. The reality was the acting was spot on and I'll give it 3 stars purely on the basis that it had some good humour points.However as a movie goes; What was this?I probably live on another planet, but the fact was, the movie was garbage. Barbie lives off the name and nothing more. Yes, the references to the classic toys was amusing and reminded me of me playing as a 4 year old kid with my 8 year old sisters Barbies. I laughed with my wife over those things, and there was an element of nostalgia but it was sort of trying to play the ""Toy Story"" game too seriously.Talking of which, Toy Story is probably one of the most amazing Pixar movies of all time. The story, the hidden lines, and personas; But Barbie, tried to take this and add something to it which it failed miserably at.The story is muddy at best, but the actors do their best to keep it above water to some degree, but ultimately it was a garbage storyline.Barbie essentially is a movie built on hype, it's history and ultimately it's name. It's a maestro example of marketing.The short of the long, you can market a turd to be something incredible, but at the end of the day, it's still a turd.",pure market hypethat,i alway knew barbi go hit miss the realiti act spot ill give star pure basi good humour pointshowev movi goe what thisi probabl live anoth planet fact movi garbag barbi live name noth ye refer classic toy amus remind play year old kid year old sister barbi i laugh wife thing element nostalgia sort tri play toy stori game seriouslytalk toy stori probabl one amaz pixar movi time the stori hidden line persona but barbi tri take add someth fail miser atth stori muddi best actor best keep water degre ultim garbag storylinebarbi essenti movi built hype histori ultim name it maestro exampl marketingth short long market turd someth incred end day still turd
Flabbergasting,"When I went to watch this movie, I went to watch it as the amazing combo, Barbinheimer (Barbie and Oppenheimer). I tried my best to avoid spoilers for both of these movies, and let me just say, going into this movie blind made this a phenomenal experience. The way Stereotypical Barbie changes is a pleasant surprise. And the way this movie deals with problems in modern society upfront and, while admittedly toned down a bit, they're all still there. The plot of this movie makes it a fantastic watch, and I was delighted by not only how the jokes were seamlessly thrown in, but the jokes themselves. This movie wasn't only just Kenough. This was so much more than being just Kenough for the children and adults in the audience. The movie's so self-aware, but it isn't the usual type, this is a type of self-awareness that can lead you to view the world differently. The problems Barbie struggles with aren't unreasonable, they're relatable at heart and spread a good message.

It's Barbie and it's Ken!,"Barbie is living a perfect life in her Barbie world filled with Barbies and Kens. Without the fear of change and the assurance of perfection, Barbie gets through the day partying until she starts thinking about death. Fearing malfunction, she is asked to visit the Real World to find her human pal to resolve the issue and get back to her perfect life. Ken follows her to the Real World where both come across patriarchy, which overwhelms them. When Barbie returns back to her world, she realizes what she is about to lose and how Barbie along with the other Barbies, couple of humans and an Allan, work together to save their world forms the story.Initially, it takes a bit of time to get used to the narrative as well as the humor. Good thing is it doesn't take much time to get me invested in the world of Barbie and Ken. The perfect casting ensured the smooth flow of the story and the likes of Kate McKinnon, Will Ferrell took care of elevating a simple scene with their impeccable comic timing. It is the final act, where Greta Gerwig proved why she is among the best to handle mother-daughter relationship or to even narrate women.There are several scenes that earns instant laughter and those scenes are cleverly handled. I did expect atleast a couple of more dance numbers. Ryan Gosling easily became pick of the lot and Margot Robbie owned her character as Barbie. The monologue scene with the mother worked for me and ofcourse the Ken's breakdown towards the end. If the first hour provides genuine humor, it is the second half that truly make it a thorough entertainer blending humor with emotions.",it barbi ken,barbi live perfect life barbi world fill barbi ken without fear chang assur perfect barbi get day parti start think death fear malfunct ask visit real world find human pal resolv issu get back perfect life ken follow real world come across patriarchi overwhelm when barbi return back world realiz lose barbi along barbi coupl human allan work togeth save world form storyiniti take bit time get use narr well humor good thing doesnt take much time get invest world barbi ken the perfect cast ensur smooth flow stori like kate mckinnon will ferrel took care elev simpl scene impecc comic time it final act greta gerwig prove among best handl motherdaught relationship even narrat womenther sever scene earn instant laughter scene cleverli handl i expect atleast coupl danc number ryan gosl easili becam pick lot margot robbi own charact barbi the monologu scene mother work ofcours ken breakdown toward end if first hour provid genuin humor second half truli make thorough entertain blend humor emot
"Why, Margot, why??","Two of my favorite actors - Margot and Ryan - in an unbelievably predictable and poorly written movie. Why would you do this to yourself Margot?? I mean, she did say in an interview that she just wanted to work with Greta, she didn't even care in what capacity. I seriously doubt she even read the script. She just wanted to be part of it. But she should have read the script. Margot is better than this! I think even a 12yo could have guessed that this was a horrible script. It was basically men vs women. Who wants to make a movie about that!!? No one. But they did. And they called it Barbie.The movie is absolutely breathtaking to look at. The cinematography and the costumes and the sets... it's all top notch. They spared nothing when it came to making this movie. Which is why I gave it 4 starts. Also, Margot and Ryan did the absolute best with what they were given. You could tell they really had to dig deep for this one.But back to the awful script. Why?!Someone with a brain somewhere out there must have read the script and thought to themselves ""I won't tell them... it's none of my business!"" Well, you should have!!! This movie cost so much money to make and so much talent was wasted on it. This could have been sooooooooo good. Instead, it was boring, predictable, trivial, preachy, and dull. Nothing original.

This movie is a shoo in for an academy award best picture. And is far, far, far more talky and intellectual than any prior best movie winner.Sure. It isn't Simone de Beauvoir. Of course it couldn't possibly be. No one would go see it. But you can feel Greta Gerwig wanting to go there and restraining herself. And yes it slips into dumb middle brow nonsense on more than one occasion, simplifying an absurdly complicated set of issues. But not to the extent that pretty much every other Hollywood movie simplifies. There is meat here. Intelligence. Not to mention tremendous performances. And fantastic set design and a totally gonzo over the top plot. And it is fun. Wild wonderful fun.You know, if you want to influence the world you first have to be popular.

"Fun, but it will get old soon","This movie was a lot of fun to watch. Everybody focuses on Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (who were obviously great), but I think America Ferrera and Will Ferrell also gave solid performances.I think both set design and wardrobe did an amazing job. There were so many fun little details and overall they nailed the mood this movie needed.What I did not like are these cringe songs. I would have left those out entirely. Also, towards the end, there was a part (a dialog), which felt really forced to me. At that point even the cinematography was terrible.We will talk about this movie for years, but most of it will be due to its clever marketing campaign, and Barbenheimer memes.

"Barbie"" (2023) is a delightful, light-hearted film","""Barbie"" has always been a beacon of aspiration and fantasy for millions across the globe, and the 2023 movie continues to build upon that legacy. However, what sets this film apart from its predecessors is its surprising infusion of humor which elevates the story from the traditional, sparkling veneer of Barbie's world.The movie makes a daring pivot from the doll's typically flawless persona, highlighting her humorous and human-like qualities. The result is a delightful concoction of wit, charm, and engaging storytelling. For those expecting a mere reiteration of the standard Barbie tropes, this film will be a pleasant surprise, as it dares to shake up the status quo with its fresh take.The screenplay is an unexpected delight, with laugh-out-loud moments woven seamlessly into the narrative. The humor doesn't feel forced or out of place, rather it helps to break down the often-perfect facade of Barbie's world, making it more relatable to the audience. It's refreshing to see Barbie and her friends involved in hilarious situations, making the narrative enjoyable for both children and adults alike.Moreover, the animation is top-notch, a delightful feast for the eyes. The detailing in each frame, the vibrant color palette, and the lifelike character animations truly capture the spirit of the Barbie world. The voice acting is commendable, breathing life into the beloved characters, and the comedic timing only adds to the film's charm.The movie is not without its flaws. Some may argue that the plot is predictable and lacks depth, a criticism often faced by films in the Barbie franchise. Despite this, the film makes up for it with its humorous approach, which keeps the audience engaged throughout.Overall, ""Barbie"" (2023) is a delightful, light-hearted film that offers a fresh and funny perspective on a beloved franchise. It retains its core appeal for younger audiences while adding elements of humor that can be appreciated by a broader demographic. If you're looking for a film that is brimming with fun, humor, and vibrant animation, then this is the movie for you.",barbi delight lightheart film,barbi alway beacon aspir fantasi million across globe movi continu build upon legaci howev set film apart predecessor surpris infus humor elev stori tradit sparkl veneer barbi worldth movi make dare pivot doll typic flawless persona highlight humor humanlik qualiti the result delight concoct wit charm engag storytel for expect mere reiter standard barbi trope film pleasant surpris dare shake statu quo fresh taketh screenplay unexpect delight laughoutloud moment woven seamlessli narr the humor doesnt feel forc place rather help break oftenperfect facad barbi world make relat audienc it refresh see barbi friend involv hilari situat make narr enjoy child adult alikemoreov anim topnotch delight feast eye the detail frame vibrant color palett lifelik charact anim truli captur spirit barbi world the voic act commend breath life belov charact comed time add film charmth movi without flaw some may argu plot predict lack depth critic often face film barbi franchis despit film make humor approach keep audienc engag throughoutoveral barbi delight lightheart film offer fresh funni perspect belov franchis it retain core appeal younger audienc ad element humor appreci broader demograph if your look film brim fun humor vibrant anim movi
"Fun, hilarious and very well made, but it's message gets muddled","The Kubrick-inspired intro was unexpected but definitely appreciated. It's a funny movie. It's got quirky and clever humor. I like how it kind of makes fun of itself as well, it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's very self aware humor. It's also silly without being annoying or repetitive. This movie is very creative and imaginative. It was a very well made movie where they paid a lot of attention to detail. Especially with all the set pieces, costumes and props. It's cool to see them bring the Barbie universe to life in live action. There's some cameos in this movie that were hilarious. Margot was wonderful as Barbie. Michael Cera as Alan was perfect. I love the guy, great and funny actor. Ryan Gosling kills it as Ken. He's got a great understanding of comedy. Kate McKinnon as weird Barbie was so good, she's hilarious. Everybody plays their part wonderfully. The movie's very colorful, warm and bright. It inspires feelings of happiness and joy. It's a very feel-good type of vibe. There's a standout moment for me when Barbie's sitting on a bench and looks around her and realizes that the imperfect real world is actually a beautiful world. With all of it's good and bad, happy and sad.Ok, now onto the bad lol. So the movie starts out really fun and funny but then gets progressively more and more preachy. The movie starts out at an 8/10 then midway through drops to a 7, by the end it goes down to a 6. It kind of takes a nosedive around the end when it becomes overly preachy with it's speeches and confusing messages. By this point I pretty much tuned out and started asking myself what the creators true intentions were and what messages they were trying to convey. I feel like the moral/message of the movie gets kind of muddled and isn't as transparent as it should be.Obviously the movie is about self discovery, identity and female empowerment but when it comes to the whole male/female subject matter, it gets confusing. Are men the evil ones, the bad ones? And women are the victims of mens patriarchy? I mean if that's the case, then the creators of this movie are completely out of touch with reality. Look at all the rights and equality women have nowadays. Look at all the women in power. All the women who own businesses, who are go-getters, who are successful entrepreneurs. This movie makes it out to seem like women are powerless, oppressed by men and the only way to get ahead is through manipulation and psychological tactics lol. It's almost offensive. I feel like the moral/message gets lost within the movie and this is its main problem.Other than that, it's a feel-good hilarious fun time!",fun hilari well made messag get muddl,the kubrickinspir intro unexpect definit appreci it funni movi it got quirki clever humor i like kind make fun well doesnt take serious it self awar humor it also silli without annoy repetit thi movi creativ imagin it well made movi paid lot attent detail especi set piec costum prop it cool see bring barbi univers life live action there cameo movi hilari margot wonder barbi michael cera alan perfect i love guy great funni actor ryan gosl kill ken he got great understand comedi kate mckinnon weird barbi good she hilari everybodi play part wonder the movi color warm bright it inspir feel happi joy it feelgood type vibe there standout moment barbi sit bench look around realiz imperfect real world actual beauti world with good bad happi sadok onto bad lol so movi start realli fun funni get progress preachi the movi start midway drop end goe it kind take nosed around end becom overli preachi speech confus messag by point i pretti much tune start ask creator true intent messag tri convey i feel like moralmessag movi get kind muddl isnt transpar beobvious movi self discoveri ident femal empower come whole malefemal subject matter get confus are men evil one bad one and woman victim men patriarchi i mean that case creator movi complet touch realiti look right equal woman nowaday look woman power all woman busi gogett success entrepreneur thi movi make seem like woman powerless oppress men way get ahead manipul psycholog tactic lol it almost offens i feel like moralmessag get lost within movi main problemoth feelgood hilari fun time
Fun and Touching Story of Womanhood,"From the opening scene, Barbie knows exactly what movie she is and what she has to say. Everything from the legacy of Barbie as a brand to the mass misunderstanding of her purpose are all handled eloquently and addressed in such a light way it keeps the movie on track without becoming a thinkpiece.The shortage of pink paint that followed this movie completely makes sense once you step inside the bright world of Barbie's dream house. What follows the __funny__ Space Odyssey recreation opening scene is a humorous but touching commentary on the journey of womanhood. Hilarious from start to finish, but will likely jump up some tears at the relatability.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling could not have been replaced by anyone else in this film; they run this film flawlessly. The Oscar-buzz surrounding Gosling's performance of Ken is not out of nowhere. Unlike any other role he's played before, it showcases his range in the comedy arena as well as giving him the opportunity to exemplify his showman qualities in a new genre. Robbie is the perfect mix of peppy, smart and sensitive to be Stereotypical Barbie and always has us rooting for her.The soundtrack is immaculate and lends to the overall experience of the Barbie world while blending it with the real world by featuring so many popular artists. The bubbly vibe and fun attitude of the movie paints a great background while clearing up the mixed messaging about what Barbie was made for and the intended impact of her invention for better and for worse.Strongly recommended for everyone; bring tissues!",fun touch stori womanhood,from open scene barbi know exactli movi say everyth legaci barbi brand mass misunderstand purpos handl eloqu address light way keep movi track without becom thinkpieceth shortag pink paint follow movi complet make sen step insid bright world barbi dream hous what follow funni space odyssey recreat open scene humor touch commentari journey womanhood hilari start finish like jump tear relatabilitymargot robbi ryan gosl could replac anyon el film run film flawlessli the oscarbuzz surround gosl perform ken nowher unlik role he play showcas rang comedi arena well give opportun exemplifi showman qualiti new genr robbi perfect mix peppi smart sensit stereotyp barbi alway u root herth soundtrack immacul lend overal experi barbi world blend real world featur mani popular artist the bubbl vibe fun attitud movi paint great background clear mix messag barbi made intend impact invent better worsestrongli recommend everyon bring tissu
"Glad I watch this movie, fantastic!","Even though she is only a doll, she does not have to be an airhead. Here in lies ""Lady Bird"" filmmaker Greta Gerwig's creative, modern-day approach to bringing one of America's most recognizable toys to life on screen. When you add that to the decision to cast Margot Robbie in the lead role, ""Barbie"" is off to the right, flawlessly arched start.Barbie's aspirational charm contributes to her brand's strength. Barbie has been criticized for imposing unattainable beauty standards, but she also served as a reminder to girls that everything is possible because different models have depicted her as the president, a rocket scientist, and even transgender. Do you know who else has inflated ideals of beauty? Celebrities in movies. They act as role models, much like Barbie, which is why Gerwig's interpretation of the wildly successful toy brand is so creative.While making Ryan Gosling's dumb Ken the brunt of most of its gender-equity humor, this film hits all the appropriate criteria. The result is a very funny children's film with the phrases of a first-year liberal arts student, which tosses around terms like ""patriarchy"" and ""appropriation"" - pretty much everything but ""problematic,"" which the film means without actually referring to Barbie's legacy.The script by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach feels most audacious on this front. The hit movie ""Barbie"" openly accuses the best-selling doll of undermining the women's movement in addition to making light of Mattel.With a subject like this, the power of nostalgia shouldn't be understated, since much of Gerwig's approach affects mature women and homosexual audiences who have owned the dolls - and for whom she has concealed references and deep-cut facts throughout. Even though Gerwig occasionally uses the film as the vehicle for what seems like a gender studies lecture for undergraduates, it is evident that the movie was created by professionals who understand how children's imaginations develop while playing with Barbies.",glad i watch movi fantast,even though doll airhead here lie ladi bird filmmak greta gerwig creativ modernday approach bring one america recogniz toy life screen when add decis cast margot robbi lead role barbi right flawlessli arch startbarbi aspir charm contribut brand strength barbi critic impos unattain beauti standard also serv remind girl everyth possibl differ model depict presid rocket scientist even transgend do know el inflat ideal beauti celebr movi they act role model much like barbi gerwig interpret wildli success toy brand creativewhil make ryan gosl dumb ken brunt genderequ humor film hit appropri criterion the result funni child film phrase firstyear liber art student toss around term like patriarchi appropri pretti much everyth problemat film mean without actual refer barbi legacyth script gerwig noah baumbach feel audaci front the hit movi barbi openli accus bestsel doll undermin woman movement addit make light mattelwith subject like power nostalgia shouldnt underst sinc much gerwig approach affect matur woman homosexu audienc own doll conceal refer deepcut fact throughout even though gerwig occasion use film vehicl seem like gender studi lectur undergradu evid movi creat profession understand child imagin develop play barbi
Silly and a waste of time,"The marketing team for this movie really need to take a bow because I honestly can't believe how this movie made so much money. It was like watching a really long toy commercial. The plot itself had some promise and there were some laughs but in general the movie was quite stupid.To start with there we're not enough big laugh moments and most of the humour was quite slapstick and lame. Secondly there seemed to be no real payoffs or explaining of choices. The only character who seemed to act in a way that was rationale was Ken, but even at the end he just gave up there was no conclusion so to speak of.The sets were quite fun and well thought out. But overall I was pretty bored and mostly waiting for the movie to be over. If you really want to watch this, wait for it to come out on the plane or on streaming platforms, don't bother spending your hard earned money on this garbage.",silli wast time,the market team movi realli need take bow i honestli cant believ movi made much money it like watch realli long toy commerci the plot promis laugh gener movi quit stupidto start enough big laugh moment humour quit slapstick lame secondli seem real payoff explain choic the charact seem act way rational ken even end gave conclus speak ofth set quit fun well thought but overal i pretti bore mostli wait movi if realli want watch wait come plane stream platform dont bother spend hard earn money garbag
Not the movie you think its going to be,"I expected this to be horrible, ditzy stereotypes, poor portrayal of each gender, or a best a 2 hour long advertisement for their toys.It was not.I cannot believe I am saying this, but this was an incredibly intelligent film! Prior to seeing it, that is the last thing I would expect to say, but it really was.Clever and witty throughout.Poor gender stereotypes? No, just the opposite. By showing how stereotypes existed in the Barbie world, then the real world and how they would later collide, it shined a light on the challenges of both genders, in again a clever and witty way.A two hour commercial? No, Mattel used it as a way to apologize for some of the mistakes it made with dolls over the years (Sugar Daddy Ken), but even then in such a clever way. This was both an affirmation of what good Barbie has done, but also an apology for all the harm it has caused with unrealistic stereotypes.Yes, it had a social agenda (again a surprise from what I went in expecting), but it succeeded in its goal without hitting you over the head, or with low brow humor.It was clever, witty and intelligent. In other words, exactly what your not expecting.",not movi think go,i expect horribl ditzi stereotyp poor portray gender best hour long advertis toysit noti believ i say incred intellig film prior see last thing i would expect say realli wasclev witti throughoutpoor gender stereotyp no opposit by show stereotyp exist barbi world real world would later collid shine light challeng gender clever witti waya two hour commerci no mattel use way apolog mistak made doll year sugar daddi ken even clever way thi affirm good barbi done also apolog harm caus unrealist stereotypesy social agenda surpris i went expect succeed goal without hit head low brow humorit clever witti intellig in word exactli expect
"""BARBIE"" REVIEW","Directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig. A runtime of one hour and fifty-four minutes. With a PG-13 rating.Narrated throughout by Helen Mirren. Starring Margot Robbie playing the world-famous Mattel toy company character ""Barbie"", specifically ""Stereotypical Barbie"". Also starring her playmate/partner and fellow toy ""Ken"", specifically ""Beach Ken"" played by Ryan Gosling.Life in ""Barbie Land"" is magnificent. Every morning is spectacular. With ""President Barbie"" played by Issa Rae, ""Doctor Barbie played by Alexandra Shipp, and ""Physicist Barbie"" played by Margot Robbie doppelgänger Emma Mackey to name a few.With many different ""Kens"" played by John Cena, Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir who's playing ""Bob Marley in next year's biopic, and Ncuti Gatwa to name a few. Oh, and you can't forget about ""Allan"" played by Michael Cera.Every day is magical until it's not. After ""Stereotypical Barbie"" started getting some weird thoughts. She is advised by ""Weird Barbie"" played by SNL Alum Kate McKinnon to go to the real world and find her human.Not wanting to leave her side ""Beach Ken"" hitches along for the ride. But once in the real world, they will learn new harsh realities. Between ""Stereotypical Barbie"" now adult human ""Gloria"" played by America Ferrera and her teenage daughter ""Sasha"" played by Ariana Greenblatt things are far from how life is in ""Barbie Land"".With ""Beach Ken"" as well getting a heavy dose of reality. These new revelations jeopardize life in ""Barbie Land"" as a whole. It will take everyone including ""Mattel Ceo"" played by Will Ferrell to fix everything that's been forever altered.""Barbie"" from the start was said to be different. Co-Writer and director Greta Gerwig said this wasn't going to be a typical ""Barbie"" film and that the viewer will be surprised. She couldn't be more right.This film appealed to little girls and women as a whole. It was deep. It touched on emotions and feelings all women feel, have felt, or will feel at some point in their life. Many women cried while watching the film because of how hard some of the points in the film hit.It wasn't all serious. It also wasn't all pink and rainbows too. It had jokes that everyone could laugh at while also having jokes that only the older viewer would get. It made sure to not take itself too seriously but also have points to make you think. I laughed throughout the film. It was really funny.The ""Kens"" were hilarious morons. Both ""Ken"" and ""Barbie"" made fun of themselves it also had points in it that were referring to some of the stuff going on in today's climate.It was fantastically done with a lot of satire. Even the overly silly stuff made a way to make it somewhat funny. Don't judge this book by the cover you will be highly surprised. So many great actors throughout that added to the film. Ryan Gosling knew the assignment.All ages, genders, and nongenders will enjoy this film. With obvious points paying homage to women. A fun film I enjoyed way more than I thought I would. Expect a lot of different emotions with some hard-hitting realities as well. Once again I have to give a shout-out to the director/co-writer for hitting the mark. Because that's a big task to ask.This was an excellent film weekend with
""Oppenheimer"" and ""Barbie"". With their respective writer/director doing an amazing job doing both. I give this film four mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥 but I expect most women to rate this five mor fires. Which makes perfect sense.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

Waste of time,"First of all, Hi all.Now let's talk about this film : Me and my wife we tried to enjoy it specially second half but apparently this is a waste of your time and money if you went to cinema or pay to see at home.First part is for kids under 10 and then it's becoming more and more interactive for adults, and then disaster.What was this???? A musical??? NO
A drama ?? NO
This film doesn't deserve 7/10 score on IMDB , where are the people who can do a proper film , I mean where the world is going.....

Makes me question my entire worldview,"I can't believe it. Humans have made a good movie. How is this metaphysically possible? Isn't badness defined as the quality uniting things that humans love?Let's start from the beginning to see where I got it wrong. In the beginning, the good God creates the universe. Ialdabaoth then creates humans in his image. Humans then excrete the civilization they love today. But somewhere in the middle of that rancid dumpster fire, there's a good movie created to sell dolls to little girls.This can mean only one thing. We were wrong when we thought intelligence is the solution to our problems. Maybe we should lobotomize the geniuses and start over.",make question entir worldview,i cant believ human made good movi how metaphys possibl isnt bad defin qualiti unit thing human lovelet start begin see i got wrong in begin good god creat univers ialdabaoth creat human imag human excret civil love today but somewher middl rancid dumpster fire there good movi creat sell doll littl girlsthi mean one thing we wrong thought intellig solut problem mayb lobotom genius start
Barbie - A Comedy Film with Something to Say,"Barbie is a film that revolves around fun and enjoyment. The story centers on our titular character, Barbie, in her world full of pink, numerous other Barbies and Kens, unique rules, and a repetitive daily routine. The movie overflows with laughter, clever remarks, musical numbers, dazzling sets, existential crises, and much more.Margot Robbie, portraying Barbie, and Ryan Gosling, playing Ken, thoroughly embodied their roles to the fullest. As the main character in her world, Barbie is admired by everyone and sought after for attention. She must adhere to the ""Stereotypical Barbie"" image with flawless perfection, which can become exhausting over time. On the other hand, Ken serves as the placeholder character for the public, and with his dry humor, he delivers the majority of laughs throughout the film, showcasing his unwavering adoration for Barbie.Director Greta Gerwig, known for her unique storytelling, showcases her creativity once again in Barbie. The dialogue is woven in a way that allows for multiple interpretations, enabling Barbie to discuss her own world and even extend beyond it. The movie transcends the boundaries of a typical comedy at times and addresses issues that resonate in our own world.The bold choice of including a reference to '2001: A Space Odyssey' before the actual start sets an enthralling mood. The film initially feels like an episode from the Twilight Zone, with the repeating day trope, but gradually reveals something amiss. These daring choices elevate Barbie from being just another comedy movie to a film with a deliberate vision.Barbie slightly teeters on the edge of delivering patriarchal messages, especially towards the end, but it manages to steer clear of crossing the line. As one of the original feminist icons since her creation in 1959, certain types of comments were inevitable. The movie addresses these issues with eloquence, all while remembering its primary purpose is to entertain and offer an escape to a fictional world.The marketing strategy for Barbie is nothing short of brilliant. Pairing it with Oppenheimer, a drastically different film, for a double feature is a stroke of genius. Viewers have the choice to immerse themselves first in the bubbly and joyful world of Barbie, followed by the thought-provoking story of Oppenheimer. The success of this marketing approach is evident in the box office results, as many attendees opted for both screenings, turning it into a global film festival with two back-to-back films.The production design, as showcased in the dazzling trailers, is impeccable, packed with intricate details, easter eggs, various era Barbies and Kens, and more. The commitment put into curating these elements from different years and presenting them in an engaging manner is commendable.Barbie arrives at an interesting time, with both writers and actors on strike, and Hollywood on the verge of temporary closure. However, the combination of Barbie and Oppenheimer offers audiences a choice and a break from the usual superhero or unnecessary sequel movies. Barbie delivers abundant laughter, lively music, outstanding performances, and takes viewers on an immensely enjoyable journey.",barbi a comedi film someth say,barbi film revolv around fun enjoy the stori center titular charact barbi world full pink numer barbi ken uniqu rule repetit daili routin the movi overflow laughter clever remark music number dazzl set existenti crise much moremargot robbi portray barbi ryan gosl play ken thoroughli embodi role fullest a main charact world barbi admir everyon sought attent she must adher stereotyp barbi imag flawless perfect becom exhaust time on hand ken serv placehold charact public dri humor deliv major laugh throughout film showcas unwav ador barbiedirector greta gerwig known uniqu storytel showcas creativ barbi the dialogu woven way allow multipl interpret enabl barbi discus world even extend beyond the movi transcend boundari typic comedi time address issu reson worldth bold choic includ refer a space odyssey actual start set enthral mood the film initi feel like episod twilight zone repeat day trope gradual reveal someth amiss these dare choic elev barbi anoth comedi movi film deliber visionbarbi slightli teeter edg deliv patriarch messag especi toward end manag steer clear cross line a one origin feminist icon sinc creation certain type comment inevit the movi address issu eloqu rememb primari purpos entertain offer escap fiction worldth market strategi barbi noth short brilliant pair oppenheim drastic differ film doubl featur stroke geniu viewer choic immers first bubbl joy world barbi follow thoughtprovok stori oppenheim the success market approach evid box offic result mani attende opt screen turn global film festiv two backtoback filmsth product design showcas dazzl trailer impecc pack intric detail easter egg variou era barbi ken the commit put curat element differ year present engag manner commendablebarbi arriv interest time writer actor strike hollywood verg temporari closur howev combin barbi oppenheim offer audienc choic break usual superhero unnecessari sequel movi barbi deliv abund laughter live music outstand perform take viewer immens enjoy journey
"Fun but shallow, dialogue is not well written","I can't add much more than has already been sit and written about this blockbuster, it's fun and pretty much what you would expect. Turn your brain off and enjoy a fun ride, my only major criticism is some badly written dialogue that seems weirdly out of place in such a high profile movie. Specifically, I mean the overuse of the unnecessary word ""literally."" That really yanked me out of the smooth ride in an otherwise well produced film where everything else is top-notch and the big budget shows. Apart from my previously mentioned criticism the dialogue is as funny as should be expected in a lighthearted fun film. In conclusion, I would recommend this as it is slightly above average, especially given its cultural significance as a phenomenon.",fun shallow dialogu well written,i cant add much alreadi sit written blockbust fun pretti much would expect turn brain enjoy fun ride major critic badli written dialogu seem weirdli place high profil movi specif i mean overus unnecessari word liter that realli yank smooth ride otherwis well produc film everyth el topnotch big budget show apart previous mention critic dialogu funni expect lightheart fun film in conclus i would recommend slightli averag especi given cultur signific phenomenon
Perfection!,"I saw Barbie yesterday with four women friends. We didn't know what to expect, but we all loved the movie! The writing was amazing. The acting was perfect. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were a great team. The music and dancing was truly entertaining. I actually cared about the characters, all the Barbies, all the Kens, as well as the mother and daughter in the ""real"" world. Will Ferrell was at his peak comedically. I also appreciated the overlay of politics, for those who are so inclined. I plan to see it again.

Falls short of greatness,"Barbie turned out to be a bit of a letdown. I had high hopes for the movie, but it didn't quite meet my expectations. The story felt forced, and the narrative lacked a decisive direction. There were moments of humor, but it missed the opportunity to be hilariously entertaining. The film could have been much better if they had taken advantage of the potential for creative and imaginative storytelling that the Barbie franchise offers. Despite the visually appealing scenes, the overall execution left me feeling unsatisfied. I hoped for a more captivating and memorable experience, but unfortunately, it fell short of delivering that. It is good entertainment.",fall short great,barbi turn bit letdown i high hope movi didnt quit meet expect the stori felt forc narr lack decis direct there moment humor miss opportun hilari entertain the film could much better taken advantag potenti creativ imagin storytel barbi franchis offer despit visual appeal scene overal execut left feel unsatisfi i hope captiv memor experi unfortun fell short deliv it good entertain
Welcome to the Dollhouse,"Barbie: the symbol of pink, pastel perfection. An iconic piece of American pop culture for more than 50 years. But nothing can prepare you for her big screen debut.Barbie is a risky and courageous new movie. This is a film that will be discussed and talked about for years to come. Greta Gerwig takes Matel's historic creation, every triumph and failure in its catalogue, and places it all within a complicated and challenging critique of what it means to be a woman. If I could compare it to another movie, I would say it's very reminiscent of Robert Townsend's Hollywood Shuffle. It leaves you wondering what kind of insane negotiations went between the film's creative team and Matel, who is also one the targets of the film's purposeful ire. It is one thing to have completed this film, and absolutely another for it to have also gotten the overwhelming promotional campaign in the months leading up to its release. Gerwig's bet is paying off big time, and you have to admit, that takes a lot of guts.Concept alone certainly isn't the film's only strength. The film is beautiful to look at. The production design is second to none in its meticulous construction of a real-life Barbie paradise. Respectively, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling give fantastic performances with plenty of complexity and dimension. I was the most touched by Rhea Perlman who gives a heartwarming portrayal of the founding mother of Barbieland, Ruth Handler. Gerwig and Baumbauch's screenplay is biting and irreverent, and by the end, nobody is left unscathed. But equally so, I belly laughed quite often and marveled at how well so many of the jokes land. The emotional depth of the film also struck a very powerful cord, complete with an ending montage that can practically leave anyone misty-eyed.Having been released on the same day as Oppenheimer, it's safe to say that the event movie is back and better than ever. After three years of streaming, it can't be overstated how wonderful that is.",welcom dollhous,barbi symbol pink pastel perfect an icon piec american pop cultur year but noth prepar big screen debutbarbi riski courag new movi thi film discus talk year come greta gerwig take matel histor creation everi triumph failur catalogu place within complic challeng critiqu mean woman if i could compar anoth movi i would say reminisc robert townsend hollywood shuffl it leav wonder kind insan negoti went film creativ team matel also one target film purpos ire it one thing complet film absolut anoth also gotten overwhelm promot campaign month lead releas gerwig bet pay big time admit take lot gutsconcept alon certainli isnt film strength the film beauti look the product design second none meticul construct reallif barbi paradis respect margot robbi ryan gosl give fantast perform plenti complex dimens i touch rhea perlman give heartwarm portray found mother barbieland ruth handler gerwig baumbauch screenplay bite irrever end nobodi left unscath but equal i belli laugh quit often marvel well mani joke land the emot depth film also struck power cord complet end montag practic leav anyon mistyeyedhav releas day oppenheim safe say event movi back better ever after three year stream cant overst wonder
Barbie (2023) -...not what I was expecting...,"So the other day (as of me writing this atleast), I watched the 2023 Barbie Movie made by Warner Bros. Going in, I was expecting it to be fun and maybe a little bit meta, but I was not expecting how meta this movie was going to be. Let me explain.Before we talk about the story, I wanna talk about the soundtrack a bit. The soundtrack is pretty good not gonna lie. As of writing this, Im currently listening to ""Choose your fighter"" and that song is great. Not all the songs are amazing (i'm probably going to get hate for this, but ""I'm just Ken"" is overrated), but the ones that do are really good.Ok, now onto the story.... the story is weird. Now, going into this I was already expecting this movie to be pro-women empowerment and meta, which I was okay with, but I was not expecting how far they were going to go with it, not that that's a bad thing, in fact I actually love it. I was not expecting Mattel, the company that makes Barbie, to be the bad guys, and i'm surprised they even signed off on that idea. The women empowerment message is also pretty good. It's not your stereotypical woman empowerment message where it's like ""Oh, you should be like Barbie, Barbie encourages all that"", no they actually question Barbie's involvement in the women's rights movement in the film and I really enjoyed that the movie is willing to look deeper into it's source material and question if the thing they're adapting is as good as people say it is. However, they eventually drop all that in the third act of the movie. Basically in the third act, the story switches gears and it's now about the Kens trying to take over Barbie land. And I basically lost interest in the movie around then since the movie spent so long investing you in the Mattel plotline so when they switch gears to this second plot, I just wanted to go back to the other plotline.In conclusion, Barbie is a very weird movie. Not what I was expecting, but I kind of love that. I love that it questions Barbie's involvement in women's culture and how they're willing to portray the company that makes Barbie in a negative light, but the movie falls apart during the third act because they completely change plot lines. Overall, I'd give it a 6/10. Thanks for watching.",barbi i expect,so day write atleast i watch barbi movi made warner bro go i expect fun mayb littl bit meta i expect meta movi go let explainbefor talk stori i wan na talk soundtrack bit the soundtrack pretti good gon na lie a write im current listen choos fighter song great not song amaz im probabl go get hate im ken overr one realli goodok onto stori stori weird now go i alreadi expect movi prowomen empower meta i okay i expect far go go that bad thing fact i actual love i expect mattel compani make barbi bad guy im surpris even sign idea the woman empower messag also pretti good it stereotyp woman empower messag like oh like barbi barbi encourag actual question barbi involv woman right movement film i realli enjoy movi will look deeper sourc materi question thing theyr adapt good peopl say howev eventu drop third act movi basic third act stori switch gear ken tri take barbi land and i basic lost interest movi around sinc movi spent long invest mattel plotlin switch gear second plot i want go back plotlinein conclus barbi weird movi not i expect i kind love i love question barbi involv woman cultur theyr will portray compani make barbi neg light movi fall apart third act complet chang plot line overal id give thank watch
Not good,"You just don't know what is the movie's point. At times it feels like a kids movie and then it doesn't and this keeps happening throughout the movie so you're not sure what is going on.There isn't much humour. Possibly at all.It tries to get serious but all you get is few disconnected moments that in the end have no meaning.

In 2023, We live in a complex society with extreme sexism which has been brilliantly addressed by none other than Barbie! The last Product that one would expect to address this issue. Was it perfect, no- nothing is perfect today. It didn't cover many topics. But did it do an excellent job at covering the topic they decided to address - absolutely YES! They can take my money - again and again for creating content that is relevant and important and changes all our perspectives. The cast was brilliant. I can't believe how many people they roped in.

The core message was to support each other,"I thought Barbie was an ok movie, especially by recent standards. It was a whimsical, borderline funny movie that presented both femininity and masculinity in both toxic and healthy versions. Part of the movie that isn't brought up much is that during the first few minutes, Barbie World, which is completely matriarchal, is shallow and plastic. Life in Barbie World is boring. Which is why after Ken brings the patriarchy from the real world almost everyone is on board. It's different and fun. Then when Barbie returns, Barbie and a couple of others use deception and manipulation to win back power. Just like some aspects (some, not all) of the patriarchy, deception and manipulation are evil too. Then after Barbie finally sees Ken's dilemma, instead of only focusing on herself, she supports him. It's Barbie and its Ken. The message of the movie is not down with the patriarchy, nor is it anti matriarchy. The message of the movie is life is hard, with ups and downs and then you die, so we should support each other. Just like how some women see sexism everywhere or how some nonwhites see racism everywhere; I think the prevalence of anti-male propaganda in modern ""entertainment"" has led some people to see male bashing everywhere. I think this movie was balanced in its fault finding and the core message was to support each other.",the core messag support,i thought barbi ok movi especi recent standard it whimsic borderlin funni movi present feminin masculin toxic healthi version part movi isnt brought much first minut barbi world complet matriarch shallow plastic life barbi world bore which ken bring patriarchi real world almost everyon board it differ fun then barbi return barbi coupl other use decept manipul win back power just like aspect patriarchi decept manipul evil then barbi final see ken dilemma instead focus support it barbi ken the messag movi patriarchi anti matriarchi the messag movi life hard up down die support just like woman see sexism everywher nonwhit see racism everywher i think preval antimal propaganda modern entertain led peopl see male bash everywher i think movi balanc fault find core messag support
Barbenheimer! Decent comedy handled with a sledgehammer,"Saw this kind of late on 07/21 after Oppenheimer. As expected the movie looks great, Barbieland is a crazy set, shot well and all actors are committed.Was a bit disappointed with Gosling but could just be the writing/direction for him. Margot Robbie and America Ferrara shine the most, and to a lesser extent Gosling, Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell (those last two are smaller side characters).Some issues with pacing or maybe the movie should've shorter, and the music wasn't all that memorable surprisingly. I would've like more songs or better yet for this whole movie to be a musical!My biggest gripe is the writing. It is painfully heavy handed, preachy and full of cringe. This is because the evil patriarchy and righteous feminism is ramped up to 100.I honestly kept checking my watch, was looking at uber's home with like 30-40min left, and struggling so hard not to walk out (i never do, always stay to the end no matter what!) or fall asleep. Maybe it was partly because I had just gotten out of the 3hr Oppenheimer (which I had a strong coffee during) but this was one of the toughest movies I had to sit through in a theater in a very long time.I think most, but still probably not all, women will enjoy it, but for the fellas? Unless you're a self described male feminist or far-left politically, or maybe just a simp, your mileage is really going to vary and this may not be for you.I like Greta Gerwig and the cast but this was a big miss and let down for me. Messaging aside, I struggle to give this higher than a 5, maybe a 6 at the absolute best, wouldn't give it lower than a 3.

6/10,"""Barbie (2023)"" earns a 6/10 for its vibrant visuals, catchy soundtrack, and a commendable attempt at modernizing the iconic character. Margot Robbie's portrayal adds depth to Barbie's character, blending humor and charm. The film's positive message of self-acceptance is well-executed, resonating with both young audiences and nostalgic adults. However, the plot feels somewhat formulaic, lacking a unique twist. The pacing occasionally drags, and certain scenes may be predictable. Despite these drawbacks, the film succeeds in delivering a feel-good experience for fans and newcomers alike.

"Watch it with a critical eye, or just have fun. Both work!","In my view there's two ways to watch / interpret Barbie. First, watch it with a critical eye about how Mattel have realised that they have to move with the times and to sell more dolls they need to 'normalise' Barbie. Second, just have fun. Both work. It is genius quite frankly. Mattel have taken criticism on the chin but ultimately know that they'll be quids in with a new 'flat footed' Barbie.You should watch it and work out where you stand. To refuse to watch it because it's ""about a doll"" is missing the point in my view. It's a great movie to just watch and have fun with but equally you could watch it with a critical eye and work out where you stand.",watch critic eye fun both work,in view there two way watch interpret barbi first watch critic eye mattel realis move time sell doll need normalis barbi second fun both work it geniu quit frankli mattel taken critic chin ultim know theyll quid new flat foot barbiey watch work stand to refus watch doll miss point view it great movi watch fun equal could watch critic eye work stand

And in the movie part, it's bad comedy and teasing yourself (Warner) quite a bit .. You have to go and see for yourself and you will definitely laugh.Ryan Gosling's acting is so good, I'm sure there's a lot of laughs out there during filming.This is another very good performance for this man.What the movie does is like imagination that doesn't have to care about logic.

"It is ""Kenough"" for me!","Barbie is one of the most iconic toys of all time! It genuinely baffled me that it took this long for there to be a Barbie film. Barbie isn't my thing, so I wasn't interested in watching this. It wasn't until the first trailer came out and the global internet cultural phenomenon ""Barbenheimer"", the release of Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day, that my interest was piqued. So is life plastic, it's fantastic? Or is it just Ken?Firstly, casting Margot Robbie as Stereotypical Barbie was perfect! She is incredibly charming and earnest in the role. She conveys a naive yet caring nature to her character while being very funny at times. Ryan Gosling as Beach Ken is also perfect casting! He is the greatest highlight with his hilarious physical performance. Every time he is on screen, he brings the laughs. Ryan also conveys a vulnerability to Ken which is surprising. Margot and Ryan have a fun chemistry together! This film has a huge cast with many playing other variations of Barbie and Ken. They are all good in their limited screen time but the stand out is Michael Cera who plays Ken's best buddy Allan. I just love how different he is from the others and how he manages to be so lovable in his limited screen time.From the first 30 minutes, you will notice the amazing costumes and set designs. Barbieland itself looks like a Barbie toy set brought to life. The massive amount of pink covering the world, the plastic look of all the accessories, houses and cars. Every Barbie and Kens clearly had a lot of thought put into their costumes because no Barbie and Ken look the same. Every costume manages to reflect the type of Barbie and Ken they are. The music score is great and the use of vocal songs was utilized effectively. Special mention to ""I'm Just Ken"" sung by Ryan Gosling! Some great dance scenes are entertaining to watch with their fun choreography. It is a comedy at heart and there are quite some funny jokes and moments with a surprising amount of great adult jokes. I also love how they poke fun at Mattel and even Barbie as a brand which is a bold move. Despite that, some strong emotional moments with one near the end can definitely tug at the heartstrings.However, the movie does suffer from some poor execution of certain elements. There is the Barbieland stuff which is enjoyable but the real-world stuff is just not that fun. It is stated early on that Barbie's thoughts are being influenced by someone playing with Barbies in the real world. How does the connection work? How much of Barbie's thought is her own? None of these things are explored, leaving many questions. On that note, certain characters will change very quickly without much build-up to these changes. Due to this, we don't get a true understanding of Barbie as a character, she changes because the film needs some kind of character development. There is also a mother and daughter character in the real world who Barbie meets. One of them is depressed and there is a rift between them but the film doesn't bother to explore the reason for any of that. We also meet Will Ferrell who plays the CEO of Mattel and he is just inconsequential to the story but takes a lot of screen time. He is also over-the-top and silly.I was hoping for a contrast between the cartoony Barbieland and the real world. However, characters in the real world act just as cartoony and ridiculous as those in Barbie Land. It makes the real-world scenes less impactful when it should have been a big moment in the film. The film is also incredibly preachy about its feminist message that it can be exhausting. Also, the 3rd act has a silly resolution that feels contradictory to the feminist nature of this film. Additionally, every male character in this film are idiotic baby and if that gets under your skin, then this movie is not for you.Overall, Barbie is a good fun time. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. This film is not going to appeal to everyone with its themes and message. Nevertheless, the movie is just plain entertaining and honestly, it is ""Kenough"" for me!",it kenough,barbi one icon toy time it genuin baffl took long barbi film barbi isnt thing i wasnt interest watch it wasnt first trailer came global internet cultur phenomenon barbenheim releas barbi oppenheim day interest piqu so life plastic fantast or kenfirstli cast margot robbi stereotyp barbi perfect she incred charm earnest role she convey naiv yet care natur charact funni time ryan gosl beach ken also perfect cast he greatest highlight hilari physic perform everi time screen bring laugh ryan also convey vulner ken surpris margot ryan fun chemistri togeth thi film huge cast mani play variat barbi ken they good limit screen time stand michael cera play ken best buddi allan i love differ other manag lovabl limit screen timefrom first minut notic amaz costum set design barbieland look like barbi toy set brought life the massiv amount pink cover world plastic look accessori hous car everi barbi ken clearli lot thought put costum barbi ken look everi costum manag reflect type barbi ken the music score great use vocal song util effect special mention im just ken sung ryan gosl some great danc scene entertain watch fun choreographi it comedi heart quit funni joke moment surpris amount great adult joke i also love poke fun mattel even barbi brand bold move despit strong emot moment one near end definit tug heartstringshowev movi suffer poor execut certain element there barbieland stuff enjoy realworld stuff fun it state earli barbi thought influenc someon play barbi real world how connect work how much barbi thought none thing explor leav mani question on note certain charact chang quickli without much buildup chang due dont get true understand barbi charact chang film need kind charact develop there also mother daughter charact real world barbi meet one depress rift film doesnt bother explor reason we also meet will ferrel play ceo mattel inconsequenti stori take lot screen time he also overthetop sillyi hope contrast cartooni barbieland real world howev charact real world act cartooni ridicul barbi land it make realworld scene le impact big moment film the film also incred preachi feminist messag exhaust also rd act silli resolut feel contradictori feminist natur film addit everi male charact film idiot babi get skin movi youoveral barbi good fun time i pleasantli surpris much i enjoy thi film go appeal everyon theme messag nevertheless movi plain entertain honestli kenough

I feel so seen- and that's what Barbie is!,"I continuously laughed and cried the whole movie. The acting is impeccable. There are so many small details and visual gags that I'm sure there were things I missed because I was laughing so much. It's clear the writers are intimately familiar with doll play, and how Barbies are actually used by children.Special shout-out to America Ferrara in this respect. Obviously Robbie and Gosling are amazing, but Ferrera brings the ""human woman"" perspective with enthusiasm and warmth. Her delivery for certain monologues is achingly relatable, and acknowledges issues facing both women and Barbie in a way that validates what women may or may not feel without judgement, just camaraderie.The movie is self aware, the auteur lens making it feel like you're watching alongside someone. I cannot imagine watching the movie and feeling alone- Greta gerwig has brought you into the fold, acknowledging your role as audience but also as witness.This is most apparent in the scenes of the movie that other reviewers have deemed feminist. The whole point of Barbie (the movie and the doll's origins) are to make women feel seen, feel valued and to show that you can be you without collecting things to validate your identity.I absolutely loved every minute of this film and I am so happy that it was made. Thank you to everyone involved in this project, you truly created movie magic.I am unsurprised that there are negative reviews for this movie, as some people do not enjoy looking at the truth head on. Suspend any need for Complacent Barbie, and embrace the wonderful magic of this movie.(barely a spoiler) the second to the last scene of Barbie made me feel the way I did when watching Lovecraft Country, episode 7 (titled ""I am."") if you need a dose of that energy before you can see the movie again, I absolutely recommend it.

Gosling helps lift the movie but Mixed,"Just saw 'Barbie' today directed by Greta Gerwig. It is a bit difficult to rate. Slow to start - a tedious first 30 or 40 mins. Didn't like the lift from 2001 either. But the latter half with Gosling somewhat makes up for the beginning. His musical number was fantastic.Aspects of it reminded me of Pleasantville, PeeWee Herman's Big Adventure, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and even a bit from the Matrix - some interesting associations.Overall kinda liked the movie but can only give it a fair rating. The Mattel chasing subplot was superfluous and detracting coupled with the slow start needing rework. Could have used better conflict focus and editing on the story I think. Needed to cut some of the vague ideas or loose ends and focus on theme of interpretation and melding of materialism/paternalism.

They Overdid It,"The movie starts off great, and has hilarious jokes throughout. For me, Ryan Gosling stole the show as he had the funniest lines and scenes. Some folks are mad about the women's empowerment themes, not me. Men have treated women as less than equal since the dawn of time, who are we to complain when they rightfully mock that? I don't mind the shots at the patriarchy, or even the fact that there's not one intelligent male character in the entire thing. What I don't like about this movie is Barbie's existential crisis. It's like they forgot the audience majority are children, and it feels like a pathetic bid for an Oscar. That arc was as off-putting as it was unnecessary. Had that element been replaced with more humor or at least a wholesome resolution, I would've given it a much higher score. They just took it to a place where it's less relatable for the children watching.",they overdid it,the movi start great hilari joke throughout for ryan gosl stole show funniest line scene some folk mad woman empower theme men treat woman le equal sinc dawn time complain right mock i dont mind shot patriarchi even fact there one intellig male charact entir thing what i dont like movi barbi existenti crisi it like forgot audienc major child feel like pathet bid oscar that arc offput unnecessari had element replac humor least wholesom resolut i wouldv given much higher score they took place le relat child watch
This is more than just a 'lighthearted comedy',"Barbie is no longer just a toy; rather, this idea of 'Barbie' has evolved into one of the most famous and significant topics in the world at this moment in time. It is so much more than merely a toy. It will not longer be just 'a toy'I must admit, as i waited in the theatre for the movie to start showing, i had my doubts. So many things scanned through my head: one was that this movie will just be a lighthearted comedy; another was that the marketing for this movie is way too extravagant for a 'comedy'; and one of the biggest was that i would lose interest in this movie soon because i tend to lose track of comedies as it is really difficult for comedy films to impress me. Boy, was I wrong.Where do I start:To start off with, this is NOT just a comedy movie. Would everyone in the theatre have been in tears by the time the movie ended if it had been a simple comedy?This movie is appealing to spectators of varying ages because of its heartwarming plot, a plot that touches everyone's heart, a topic that is heavy in nature but simple in the showcasing of this topic throughout the movie.Barbie focuses on the story of Stereotypical Barbie & Ken... Barbie starts to experience strange thoughts and strange symptoms which causes her to travel to the real world with Ken to find the child who is playing with her doll and to fix the issue. When reading this plot, it is easy to imagine that this is just a comedy, action, simple film etc. However, this is only the PLOT... the storyline is very different.The opening scene itself focuses on a rather heavy topic of childhood, stereotypes, a new generation etc. With Barbie (Margot Robbie) appearing and the one of the little girls smashing her dolls to pieces, this was a very symbolic gesture to add right at the beginning of the film. It is is symbolic in the sense that, the young girl smashing her dolls represents a new generation in which dolls are not played with, it may also represent girls smashing or declining 'their dreams' due to female stereotypes (a topic that is heavy in this film) - I liked that Gerwig made it clear in the first 10 seconds of the movie that this film is not one to be taken lightly.Good comedic scenes are present throughout the film. Such as the jokes about Alan... however, even though Alan being on his own and not many people caring about Alan are seen as 'comedy' - I feel that there is much more behind Alan, and that making his scenes comedic are just a barrier, and that Gerwig wants spectators to take apart these scenes and to analyse what is behind that wall. That being Alan may represent 'women' in the sense that in this male-dominant world, women are constantly feeling pressured and alone, and not listened to.I like how Gerwig didn't make a whole 'new' concept of Barbie... this added to the topic of childhood and simplicity. I particularly liked how when Barbie floats from the top of her dream house to her car, this was symbolic as when young children play with Barbies, that is how they get their Barbie doll down too, they bring the barbie down as if it is floating, I really liked this detail, had innocence to it.Further on in the movie, the topics start to get heavier: For example when Barbie meets Sasha. Sasha described first world problems such as feminism, here Gerwig had SUDDENLY brought in these topics, without warning. Again, I liked this because it shows how suddenly this world makes decisions regarding women's rights, and how quick this world is to judge women.Ken's storyline was also an intricate part of the movie, the 2nd half of the movie is solely based on Ken wanting to not just be Ken and Barbie, but wanting to feel important. In the end, Ken realises that he is important too. Gerwig does this really well.... Although this movie highlights topics relating to women's rights, the end juxtaposes that in a sense and just shows that everyone is equal, and that was a nice message to finish the film off.The ending montage of childhood, barbies, children etc was a really heart-wrenching moment, a great way to end the movie... Gerwig played with emotions here, spectators started off the movie laughing, and ended in crying. Great way to showcase opposing topics.All in all, fantastic movie.",thi lightheart comedi,barbi longer toy rather idea barbi evolv one famou signific topic world moment time it much mere toy it longer toyi must admit wait theatr movi start show doubt so mani thing scan head one movi lightheart comedi anoth market movi way extravag comedi one biggest would lose interest movi soon tend lose track comedi realli difficult comedi film impress boy i wrongwher i startto start not comedi movi would everyon theatr tear time movi end simpl comedythi movi appeal spectat vari age heartwarm plot plot touch everyon heart topic heavi natur simpl showcas topic throughout moviebarbi focus stori stereotyp barbi ken barbi start experi strang thought strang symptom caus travel real world ken find child play doll fix issu when read plot easi imagin comedi action simpl film etc howev plot storylin differentth open scene focus rather heavi topic childhood stereotyp new gener etc with barbi margot robbi appear one littl girl smash doll piec symbol gestur add right begin film it symbol sen young girl smash doll repres new gener doll play may also repres girl smash declin dream due femal stereotyp topic heavi film i like gerwig made clear first second movi film one taken lightlygood comed scene present throughout film such joke alan howev even though alan mani peopl care alan seen comedi i feel much behind alan make scene comed barrier gerwig want spectat take apart scene analys behind wall that alan may repres woman sen maledomin world woman constantli feel pressur alon listen toi like gerwig didnt make whole new concept barbi ad topic childhood simplic i particularli like barbi float top dream hous car symbol young child play barbi get barbi doll bring barbi float i realli like detail innoc itfurth movi topic start get heavier for exampl barbi meet sasha sasha describ first world problem femin gerwig suddenli brought topic without warn again i like show suddenli world make decis regard woman right quick world judg womenken storylin also intric part movi nd half movi sole base ken want ken barbi want feel import in end ken realis import gerwig realli well although movi highlight topic relat woman right end juxtapos sen show everyon equal nice messag finish film offth end montag childhood barbi child etc realli heartwrench moment great way end movi gerwig play emot spectat start movi laugh end cri great way showcas oppos topicsal fantast movi
A mature take on Barbie,"The latest installment in the Barbie movie franchise takes an unexpected turn, veering away from the child-friendly themes that fans have come to expect. In this new adventure, Barbie finds herself navigating the complexities of the real world, facing a stark realisation that men rule the world - much to Ken's delight.While this plotline may spark debate and offer an occasion for intellectual discourse, it's crucial to remember the intended audience of such movies. Given its 12A certificate, this film should not be regarded as a children's movie. Parents expecting lighthearted entertainment may be caught off-guard when sitting down with their young ones.For those who are able to appreciate its more mature themes and humour, moments of levity can be found. However, with a slow beginning that only picks up halfway through, some viewers may struggle to maintain interest. Furthermore, the film's rushed conclusion leaves much to be desired and falls short in satisfying fans' craving for a cohesive storyline.Potential audience members should weigh whether the departure from traditional child-oriented content is worth viewing or not.In summary, while this unique approach to a Barbie movie has its merits, it should be approached with caution by parents of younger children due to its mature themes and occasional tedium.",a matur take barbi,the latest instal barbi movi franchis take unexpect turn veer away childfriendli theme fan come expect in new adventur barbi find navig complex real world face stark realis men rule world much ken delightwhil plotlin may spark debat offer occas intellectu discours crucial rememb intend audienc movi given a certif film regard child movi parent expect lightheart entertain may caught offguard sit young onesfor abl appreci matur theme humour moment leviti found howev slow begin pick halfway viewer may struggl maintain interest furthermor film rush conclus leav much desir fall short satisfi fan crave cohes storylinepotenti audienc member weigh whether departur tradit childori content worth view notin summari uniqu approach barbi movi merit approach caution parent younger child due matur theme occasion tedium

Barbie Impresses in an Interesting Way,"Barbie, while not something I would typically watch, caught my interest. I watched the trailer and felt as though this would not be a typical kids movie. The humor surprised me as I laughed multiple times. The cameos were great. The main cast was perfectly cast. Ryan Gosling shined as Ken.

Hi Barbie !,"Honestly Barbie turned out to be a pretty good film, the concept was already a good one and the execution was really good. The movie did feel a bit long though, a few scenes that felt dragged out. I like the mother and daughter, they were like the audience's soul within the movie.The quote where mothers stand still to show their daughters how far they've gone/made it was really beautiful, my mother cried during that scene.Ryan Gosling shined a lot during this film and I liked that since he represented men. (In a way) opinion.Overall really super enjoyable movie for all ages. More so for the adults in my opinion, great message for the Barbies and the Kens of our real world.",hi barbi,honestli barbi turn pretti good film concept alreadi good one execut realli good the movi feel bit long though scene felt drag i like mother daughter like audienc soul within movieth quot mother stand still show daughter far theyv gonemad realli beauti mother cri sceneryan gosl shine lot film i like sinc repres men in way opinionoveral realli super enjoy movi age more adult opinion great messag barbi ken real world
The clash of the decade,"Barbie vs Oppenheimer, was an amazing event to take place, if you want to say they were even going against each other, it was very enjoyable to see this take place though.But as for Barbie the movie was okay in my opinion, it was no doubt hilarious and joyful, I would probably rewatch it for that reason. But the movie itself just kind of lacked something, I think the story was okay, had some good messages. Some parts just didn't work well, the storyline of the daughter didn't make sense, because one scene she's mean and terrible then all of the sudden she's nice, just didn't work that well.But overall it was just okay, probably won't watch it again.",the clash decad,barbi v oppenheim amaz event take place want say even go enjoy see take place thoughbut barbi movi okay opinion doubt hilari joy i would probabl rewatch reason but movi kind lack someth i think stori okay good messag some part didnt work well storylin daughter didnt make sen one scene she mean terribl sudden she nice didnt work wellbut overal okay probabl wont watch

Very boring movie from the beginning till the end.Throughout the whole movie, I just wanted the movie to be already over. That's how bored i was and how much it wss not interesting.

weakness to strength,"Greta Gerwig Director of Little women and Lady bird did a great job directing movie Barbie. I did not own or play with barbie dolls. Made the whole concept of Barbie very enjoyable and motivational for women in general .Margot Robbie is perfect as Barbie, beautiful in appearance, perky by nature. After stepping into reality , Barbie meets strong women ..different Barbie.. There is a Barbie with different labels... women in all fields. Conventional ordinary Barbie is not ordinary anymore. The movie is 1hr 54 minutes. In the beginning it is all about beautiful Barbie and then a beautiful twist to the story with planet earth having Barbie in all aspects and professions of life. I thoroughly enjoyed Ken ( excellent lovable Ryan Gosling) wanting Barbie and seeking for conventional Barbie in now matured Barbie Margot Robbie. Fun, great movie with lots of lessons for empowering women and teaching little girls to step out of beautiful fake kitchens and playhouses and feeding dolls. New dimension to womanhood is beautifully embedded in impressionable brains of little girls and teenagers rushing in pink clothes to feel like Barbie. Great job , Greta Gerwig.

You are KENough.,"""Humans have only one ending. Ideas live forever.""Sometimes in life, you embrace being you because you are KENough.On a serious note, I had a great time with Barbie.Do not let the title or poster fool you into thinking this is another stupid kid's movie for little girls because despite the colourful and happy-go-lucky comedic start with the introduction of Barbie Land. The film quickly and suddenly goes into mature themes, where the narrative shifts to gender roles in society, mostly on women.But as soon as the line ""Do you ever think about dying?"" drops, you are in for something different. Weirdly enough, this reminded me of The Lego Movie, and what is even stranger is that it stars Will Ferrell.One of the most amusing parts I got from the movie is that the film feels ""insidery"" and what I mean by that is that it speaks to women and is made for them, which only they will truly understand. So, any comedic or emotional scenes regarding female experiences will have a bigger laugh and impact for them, while the guys are not picking it up. On the other hand, it manages not to alienate, and that's very tricky to pull off. Anyone can still enjoy it, but it's just something I notice with the audience. I mean, it is why it's having such a positive reaction, both box office and reception, as audiences and critics finally got something that strikes a decent balance of being entertaining and well-made.Margot Robbie is fantastic as the main Barbie. She portrayed her character's feelings, thoughts, and inner turmoil beautifully. It's another ensemble film where everyone does solid work.But man, Ryan Gosling as Ken is fantastic. Gosling is one of the best comedic talents of today. I would say this - Gosling's casting as Ken is up there with Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean. I hope he gets an Oscar nomination for this. Yep, I am dead serious. Whenever Gosling was on screen, I was smiling from ear to ear. His passion for the character is both amusing and hilarious. His musical number I'm Just Ken was the highlight.Director Greta Gerwig is one of the most unique voices in cinema right now. Her influences with classic cinema, mostly in music, dance, and rich visuals are on display here. Her directing for the musical segments, especially with 'I'm Just Ken', is fantastic.The movie has flaws. It can get overstuffed with so much going on, and the preachy message can be too much at points. It needed more nuance. But that is it for problems.If you are a guy, check this one out. Go out of your comfort zone.With the internet phenomenon known as Barbenheimer, who would have thought that a movie based on a doll and another film about the creation of the nuclear bomb would save cinema? Hopefully, this is a sign of great things to come. Audiences are hungry for quality again.",you kenough,human one end idea live foreversometim life embrac kenoughon seriou note i great time barbiedo let titl poster fool think anoth stupid kid movi littl girl despit colour happygolucki comed start introduct barbi land the film quickli suddenli goe matur theme narr shift gender role societi mostli womenbut soon line do ever think die drop someth differ weirdli enough remind the lego movi even stranger star will ferrellon amus part i got movi film feel insideri i mean speak woman made truli understand so comed emot scene regard femal experi bigger laugh impact guy pick on hand manag alien that tricki pull anyon still enjoy someth i notic audienc i mean posit reaction box offic recept audienc critic final got someth strike decent balanc entertain wellmademargot robbi fantast main barbi she portray charact feel thought inner turmoil beauti it anoth ensembl film everyon solid workbut man ryan gosl ken fantast gosl one best comed talent today i would say gosl cast ken johnni depp jack sparrow pirat caribbean i hope get oscar nomin yep i dead seriou whenev gosl screen i smile ear ear hi passion charact amus hilari hi music number im just ken highlightdirector greta gerwig one uniqu voic cinema right her influenc classic cinema mostli music danc rich visual display her direct music segment especi im just ken fantasticth movi flaw it get overstuf much go preachi messag much point it need nuanc but problemsif guy check one go comfort zonewith internet phenomenon known barbenheim would thought movi base doll anoth film creation nuclear bomb would save cinema hope sign great thing come audienc hungri qualiti
Film was overhyped as expected,Some didn't like the messages in this film but I felt those were it's strongest moments. Everything else was just your typical children's movie. Barbie Land stayed true to its source with its varies costumes and its design. I like musicals but I didn't gravitate to any of the songs in this film. Margot Robbie plays her role well and gives this movie a bit more emotion than I thought it would have. There were some funny moments but nothing laugh out loud.In the end this film was not a standout for me. It's not a film I would watch again. If this film was called anything else I'm sure it would have never gotten the attention that it did. Once the barbies came up with their plan against the Kens it just became very silly and I was waiting for it to be over.,film overhyp expect,some didnt like messag film i felt strongest moment everyth el typic child movi barbi land stay true sourc vari costum design i like music i didnt gravit song film margot robbi play role well give movi bit emot i thought would there funni moment noth laugh loudin end film standout it film i would watch if film call anyth el im sure would never gotten attent onc barbi came plan ken becam silli i wait
Fantastic!,"Barbie is fantastic from beginning to end. I was hooked in from the beginning of seeing Barbie Land and how it was portrayed. I thought their decision to make it like real dolls from the acting, to the production and set design was perfect, creative, and clever. It was also a little bit unexpected and surprising. Loved all of that. The script is great as a whole as well. Greta and Noah Baumbach wrote, I think a really intriguing story here. Greta's direction is also excellent. Also the cast all nails it here. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling especially. The soundtrack was great as well and fit perfectly. Everything with this I feel just fit pretty seamlessly together and it delivered in the end.

"Strikingly bright, vibrant, colourful & musical fun - with a heavy-handed deeper message","The colourful & musical ""Barbie"" is set in the plastic uptopia of Barbieland - a Helen Mirren narrated doll's world of: 'Stereotypical Barbie' Margot Robbie; token Kens like Ryan Gosling (with HIS token Michael Cera) & John Cena; empowered Barbies like Issa Rae & Alexandra Shipp; and 'Weird Barbie' Kate McKinnon - into which existential confusion seeps (with Mattel CEO Will Ferrell) via a portal to the real world (thru America Ferrera (great)).

"Smart, hilarious and so creative all at the same time!","So hilarious and intelligently written. The writers sincerely can't be credited enough with how smart and funny this movie is. It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and find new jokes, there's just so many! If you're uptight about the way many women feel how they ""fit into"" society, then this movie may not be for you. But, you're missing out. I hope the academy finally starts recognizing comedies. It's so much more difficult to write something funny and be an actor that can pull of true comedy than drama. It just is. You have to be new, creative and intelligent. Dramas, you can just play things that people automatically get emotional about, It's so hard to figure out what many will find funny, yet alone hilarious.

Entertaining bubblegum fluff piece lacks true subtlety,"Consistently entertaining, imaginative, and occasionally wickedly funny, Greta Gerwig helms an audaciously original take on the iconic doll, fashioning a pastel wonderland with deeper, albeit crudely pushed, morals and ideas. Margot Robbie stars as Barbie, the stereotypical perfect doll whose carefree existence in the utopian Barbieland is one day disrupted, leading her eventually into the real world, accompanied by the hapless Ken, played by Ryan Gosling in a valiant attempt to drag character from caricature.Baumbach and Gerwig's script is loaded with references and nods to many aspects of pop culture, pulling them off pretty successfully with the aid of Gerwig's direction, which matches the tone of the script perfectly, at turns breathlessly light and then scathingly precise.The production design team in particular clearly got much of the funding, with lush and detailed sets, picture-perfect outfits, and enough pink to cause a temporary world shortage of the colour. Robbie in particular does a fabulous job of capturing the subtleties of inner struggles behind a perfect facade, and it is on her character that the movie finds its feet and produces sparks of deeper emotion. Gosling, meanwhile, delivers some of the best comedic timing and lines of the movie, and does his best to convince us that the script did not severely underwrite his role, or in fact the roles of everyone save the idea of womanhood.For a movie which purports to deliver a nuanced take on the influence of Barbie and the implications of its commercial success in a world admittedly mostly governed by men, parts of the script come off as overly preachy and about as subtle as the amount of pink in this movie. This does detract from the entertainment factor, especially with the mild stakes and average pacing, meaning that when you're looking at it, it's nice to look at, but you could easily not be looking at it either.Many of the ideas introduced are thought-provoking and interesting in the context of the meaning of humanity, especially in the first two acts. In the third, much of those ideas get resolved far too easily, and on a couple occasions, in a manner which undercuts the message of equality it purports to show.There are some standout moments, especially a ridiculously funny and entertaining sequence featuring Gosling's Ken towards the end, and one or two impactful, quiet moments where Robbie and Gerwig gel together perfectly, but in between them is a vacuous fantasy that rests somewhere comfortably between bubblegum fluff and feminist hit piece.Another thing to note is the music, which is superb throughout, and matched mostly by Gerwig's direction and her staging of some great sequences.Never a struggle to watch, shot through with occasionally successfully executed ideas, it leaves one with a good feeling, but nothing as lasting as it wishes it could be.",entertain bubblegum fluff piec lack true subtleti,consist entertain imagin occasion wickedli funni greta gerwig helm audaci origin take icon doll fashion pastel wonderland deeper albeit crude push moral idea margot robbi star barbi stereotyp perfect doll whose carefre exist utopian barbieland one day disrupt lead eventu real world accompani hapless ken play ryan gosl valiant attempt drag charact caricaturebaumbach gerwig script load refer nod mani aspect pop cultur pull pretti success aid gerwig direct match tone script perfectli turn breathlessli light scathingli preciseth product design team particular clearli got much fund lush detail set pictureperfect outfit enough pink caus temporari world shortag colour robbi particular fabul job captur subtleti inner struggl behind perfect facad charact movi find foot produc spark deeper emot gosl meanwhil deliv best comed time line movi best convinc u script sever underwrit role fact role everyon save idea womanhoodfor movi purport deliv nuanc take influenc barbi implic commerci success world admittedli mostli govern men part script come overli preachi subtl amount pink movi thi detract entertain factor especi mild stake averag pace mean your look nice look could easili look eithermani idea introduc thoughtprovok interest context mean human especi first two act in third much idea get resolv far easili coupl occas manner undercut messag equal purport showther standout moment especi ridicul funni entertain sequenc featur gosl ken toward end one two impact quiet moment robbi gerwig gel togeth perfectli vacuou fantasi rest somewher comfort bubblegum fluff feminist hit pieceanoth thing note music superb throughout match mostli gerwig direct stage great sequencesnev struggl watch shot occasion success execut idea leav one good feel noth last wish could

Cute existentialism,"Barbie is exactly the movie the trailers promised. Different from what you expect from a toy adaptation but not fully up to the talents of the writers and director involved. An existential comedy for little girls and adults is the best way it can be described. It's very well made with the use of extensive sets and amazing actors in it. Entertaining throughout the movie even if it is mostly predictable. Great message even if it gets preachy a little bit, which surely is going to invite a lot of hate towards it too. It also shows different sides of the kind of issues in our world by juxtaposition. The self-awareness works to a point too. But the constant and blatant toy promotion kind of makes the whole thing almost pointless. I mean, I get it that Mattel only made this so they can sell their toys and was ready for the film to criticise them for the same but do they really have to overcompensate for that like this?",cute existenti,barbi exactli movi trailer promis differ expect toy adapt fulli talent writer director involv an existenti comedi littl girl adult best way describ it well made use extens set amaz actor entertain throughout movi even mostli predict great messag even get preachi littl bit sure go invit lot hate toward it also show differ side kind issu world juxtaposit the selfawar work point but constant blatant toy promot kind make whole thing almost pointless i mean i get mattel made sell toy readi film criticis realli overcompens like

Barbie,"""Thus Spake Zarabarbie"" - that's the opening message as narrated by Dame Helen Mirren who gives us a potted history of the doll - from it's origins as an inanimate plaything of young girls to it's current status as an empowering conduit for young girls to emerge into society as uninhibited and aspirational beings with only the sky as the limit. Well, that's the philosophy in Margot Robbie's ""Barbieland"". A sterile sort of environment that lives it's life along the lines of a pink ""Groundhog Day"". Men? Well yes, there are - as embodied by the tanned, rippled and toned ""Ken"" (Ryan Gosling) but they are very much the in-app purchase in this world, with little purpose aside from augmenting a ""Barbie"". Strangely, one morning, the stereotypical ""Barbie"" finds she has lost some of her charm! She is flat footed, her endlessly elysian existence is fraying at the edges? What do do? See ""Weird Barbie"" (Emerald Fennell) and seek her sagely advice. That, however, she doesn't like. She must enter into the real world and find whoever is supposed to be playing with her - clearly not an happy girl - and see if she can cheer her up and restore the equilibrium. En route, she finds that her ever devoted ""Ken"" will join her and their arrival in the big city introduces both to a bewildering world of sexists, misogynists and cynics. The latter best exemplified by ""Sasha"" - her somewhat disenchanted owner. When the boss of Mattel (Will Ferrell) discovers her escape, he mobilises the whole of his organisation to get her back in her box whilst an equally disillusioned but newly engaged ""Ken"" heads back to his home realising that maybe the men don't have to live quite such understudy lives. Can she elude her pursuers long enough to befriend ""Sasha"", her much less cyclical mother ""Gloria"" (America Ferrera) and then get home before both of her world's are alien to her? This is good fun, this. Gosling is a talented actor who can also churn out a decent power ballad (there are a few) and there is the oddest of chemistries here between him and an very much on-form Robbie who puts her heart and her soul (and loads of joyous/bemused facial expressions) into this role. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have written a witty script that pitches the naive and the innocent in with the venal and the observational. It swipes at all things sexist - and not just from the woman's perspective either - and though it does ridicule the restrictions society has put on the historical progression of women through the ranks of corporate America, it does so in a positive and enjoyable satirical manner. Will Ferrell - I can take him or leave him - is really only adequate as the epitome of the male dominated company structure but there is quite a nice set of scenes with Rhea Perlman (for ever ""Carla"" from ""Cheers!"") who portrays the inventor - if that is the word - of the whole ""Barbie"" concept, and who knits it all nicely together towards the end. Don't be a snob about this, get yourself into a cinema and prepare to be entertained. Bergman it isn't, but an enjoyable evaluation and parody of 21st century life, opportunity and all things vacuous it certainly is.",barbi,thu spake zarabarbi that open messag narrat dame helen mirren give u pot histori doll origin inanim playth young girl current statu empow conduit young girl emerg societi uninhibit aspir be sky limit well that philosophi margot robbi barbieland a steril sort environ live life along line pink groundhog day men well ye embodi tan rippl tone ken ryan gosl much inapp purchas world littl purpos asid augment barbi strang one morn stereotyp barbi find lost charm she flat foot endlessli elysian exist fray edg what see weird barbi emerald fennel seek sage advic that howev doesnt like she must enter real world find whoever suppos play clearli happi girl see cheer restor equilibrium en rout find ever devot ken join arriv big citi introduc bewild world sexist misogynist cynic the latter best exemplifi sasha somewhat disench owner when bos mattel will ferrel discov escap mobilis whole organis get back box whilst equal disillus newli engag ken head back home realis mayb men dont live quit understudi live can elud pursuer long enough befriend sasha much le cyclic mother gloria america ferrera get home world alien thi good fun gosl talent actor also churn decent power ballad oddest chemistri much onform robbi put heart soul load joyousbemus facial express role greta gerwig noah baumbach written witti script pitch naiv innoc venal observ it swipe thing sexist woman perspect either though ridicul restrict societi put histor progress woman rank corpor america posit enjoy satir manner will ferrel i take leav realli adequ epitom male domin compani structur quit nice set scene rhea perlman ever carla cheer portray inventor word whole barbi concept knit nice togeth toward end dont snob get cinema prepar entertain bergman isnt enjoy evalu parodi st centuri life opportun thing vacuou certainli
"""Barbie"" talks about choices and changes and touches some important questions, however Barbie doll was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy","Despite the strong commercial tone, it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by Greta Gerwig. And the undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. ""Barbie"" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the ""corporate"" issue. It won't be strange if you catch yourself thinking ""how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?"" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.In the debate proposal for important social disparities in the face of the artificial tackiness of the Barbie Universe, the direction manages to create precious dialogues and situations, very well dosed with humor and other variations of the dramatic genre that permeate the acts of the project. In these changes of atmosphere, we were able to appreciate the creative photography by Rodrigo Prieto - who shoots 50 shades of pink in the same scene without making us want to vomit - and the dozens of visual references that influenced the director in the aesthetic configuration, between composition of scenes and very particular plastic choices, such as costume pieces, type of hair or cinephile jokes that we had already had contact with since the trailer parodying 2001: A Space Odyssey. Here, we'll catch glimpses of ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""The Truman Show""; we'll go through the fairytale-like artificiality of Jacques Demy's films; for the dance and choreographic performance of Gene Kelly; for the visual and dramatic intensity of The Little Red Shoes and All That Jazz... it's a lot. ""Barbie"" is a well of enriching cinematographic references.But, leaving aside that the film is indeed fun and has a creative and stunning look, in addition to addressing important points of today's society, Greta Gerwig ends up exaggerating her hand and transforms ""Barbie"" into a blatant and extremely exaggerated feminist activism. The production is very much in line with a famous Quentin Tarantino interview in 2021 given to Bill Maher on his HBO broadcast ""Real Time"" in which he said: ""Ultimately, ideology trumps art, individual effort, good, entertainment"". Unfortunately, in this film, this doll that belonged to the imagination of several generations of women was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy, full of language, allegories, open messages and ideological discourses. The film misses an opportunity to be a film for everyone, to be a comedy and romance epic, and it had the quality to do so, but it preferred to focus on the most brazen militancy that cinema has ever produced, trying to please a specific audience and clearly attack certain targets of this ideological patrol.The film has an interesting premise, that's undeniable, and it flows most of the time, but the audience is bombarded with pervasive indoctrination especially in the art scene at every turn. Since the target audience here is females of all ages, this audience may even enter the cinema wanting to be entertained, but will graduate in all subjects addressed among feminists: an ode to the intrinsic evil of patriarchy; criticism of beauty standards; the hypocritical discourse against consumerism (as if Warner, Mattel, artists were not going to profit millions from movie ticket sales, from selling new dolls, etc.); man-hatred (all men portrayed in the film are portrayed as idiots, greedy, dumb, or wanting power for themselves). Greta Gerwig's goal as a screenwriter is super smart in this regard, because the ""Stereotyped"" Barbie comes to the real world completely innocent and she is being indoctrinated following the feminist primer that shows how she has to think and act, mainly in the perception of men and progressive militancy - the character Sasha, played by Ariana Greenblatt, is the one who plays this role, like the militant of today, always connected and who knows everything about life (where Gerwig puts her speech in the mouth of the character so that she speaks her true s intentions).The truth is that the film essentially revolves around hate, not love. Barbie, here, hates men, capitalism, fun and hates Barbie doll herself (calling her a fascist and worse throughout the plot). Barbie also hates women who have cute memories of the doll, if you're a woman and you played with her as a kid, according to the movie, you supported patriarchy. Barbie can't just be a pretty, blonde, thin woman either, after all, that doesn't encompass the mandatory ""diversity and inclusion"" in Hollywood today. To resolve this issue, they created a universe in which everyone is Barbie (we even have a Barbie who was born a man, yes, a trans Barbie - who, by the way, is a doctor). The men in Barbieland (who cares) are there to be mistreated and ignored. Ken is just an accessory. When Barbie and Ken come into the real world, everything changes. Ken discovers patriarchy (a word spoken a dozen times throughout the plot) and likes that world. Barbie finds unbridled machismo (if Barbie were set in the 60s it would even make a little sense). Romance between Barbie and Ken? Not at all, after all that wouldn't be ""empowering"" at all. Ken even rejects the doll at one point.Ken represents the ""evil patriarchy"". Everything in this film becomes one big lecture, one big sermon (Barbie scolding workers who whistle at her; police officers harassing Barbie at the police station; a man slapping her on the butt out of the blue), that is, victim of the ""toxic"" men of the world. Barbie still has to choose between flip-flops and heels, showing that in the end there is only one choice to be made: follow feminism, that is, flip-flops. We also have the passage of the protagonist Gloria cheating on her husband (a fool, by the way), and the film shows that the betrayal was legal and she had an advantage in cheating.All male clichés are portrayed here according to the feminist view (because apparently men have had no problems in life since the beginning of time, according to the film's script). Here, the Barbies were co-opted by the brainwashing of patriarchy and used by the Kens in a kind of macho dystopia. Everything Ken likes is depicted as toxic, evil, and terrible (Stallone, Godfather, horses, Zack Snyder, etc.). Barbieland is portrayed as a perfect world for women (women have everything, men have nothing); Mattel executives are all portrayed as white, straight men and still calls this type of profile ""conservative fascist"". For the director, it is never enough to be a woman, you have to be a mother, a wife, work and still receive criticism. The unsuspecting will also believe that even today women do not have leadership positions in large companies, and that they cannot study, work and that they receive lower wages than men doing the same type of work (Yes, because apparently the ""evil businessmen"" hire men to pay higher wages when they could pay less for a woman to do the same job!!). At the end of the plot, Gloria's feminist discourse is the antidote to the brainwashing of oppressive patriarchy. Kens are beaten because they are ""dumb"". The Barbies' plan was to pretend to be submissive and then make their respective Ken jealous with another Ken, of course, after all, all men only know how to create wars, destroy everything they lay their hands on and are automatically stupid (After all, if men are stupid, why do they dominate the world according to what was propagated in the film? A basic and inexplicable plot hole here).""Barbie"" is a great satire, but when it touches on feminist issues, it gets serious and uses irony to make fun of men, since women are portrayed as being totally perfect. Sasha and Gloria are the main Latin characters here and the Barbie character is just the shell for the director to propagate her feminist ideas. Obviously, the film will have an excellent box office due to all the hype and marketing made for the film and, of course, the popularity of the Barbie doll that has been successful for generations, in addition to having many merits, especially in the technical part. The detailed, creative and extremely tasteful scenarios, especially in Barbieland, are a spectacle in themselves, in addition to the magnificent performances by Margot Robbie (charismatic and incredibly beautiful) and Ryan Gosling (hilarious as ever). The musicals, on the other hand, are horrible, poorly performed and owing a lot in that regard.""Barbie"" talks about choices and changes. In the hands of Greta Gerwig, the typical behavior of dolls and dolls, via imagination, takes on a critical form and points to many paths, visiting metalanguage, political-social relations, patriarchy and feminism, feelings (including the arrogant and insensitive posture of Barbie in front of Ken; as well as the unhealthy dependence of the doll on his girlfriend), existential crises or acceptance of one's social and gender condition. The work fulfilled the promise that we would have a product different from what could be imagined from a live-action Barbie, that is undeniable. The problem is that, in the end, ""Barbie"" doesn't even get a satisfactory answer to the simplest question of her journey of self-discovery. ""Who is Barbie?"": the only possible conclusion is that it is a toy that has ensured at least two more decades of popularity.",barbi talk choic chang touch import question howev barbi doll drag

NOSTALGIA,"This movie is NOT what I expected at all. I thought it would be your average formulaic movie, but no. This movie is deep. It explores topics such as feminism & the patriarchy, femininity, existentialism, and a lot more. It uses incredible comedy to make its points, and hence, doesn't come across preachy at all.Greta Gerwig is absolutely incredible, this is 100% her best work so far. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling did a splendid job, as did the rest of the supporting characters.Also, the nostalgia you'll feel when you watch this movie is insane. It's so crazy how similar every girl's Barbie play-stories are.

Clever script propels the movie,"""Barbie"" (2023 release; 114 min) opens with a nice twist/spoof on ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" regarding the arrival of Barbie dolls (as opposed to baby dolls). We then go to ""BarbieLand"" as Barbie wakes up and starts a new and perfect day. Alas, the next day is anything but perfect, and Barbie must go to the real world to fix things...Couple of comments: the long, long awaited real life action film adaptation of ""Barbie"" is finally here, and to be honest I had no idea what to expect. Surely I am not the target audience and I almost certainly would not have bothered to even check this out, except that this is directed (and co-written and co-produced) by Greta Gerwig, for whom I have tremendous respect as a film maker (and not just as an actress). In fact, it turns out that the script, co-written with her real life partner Noan Baumbach) is clever (but not too clever) and socially self-aware (but not too much and hence not preachy). The script is in fact what propels this movie, although of course there are many other aspects which make this film a good movie experience. The cast, led by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is top-notch. The production set is great, and the song contributions are tops. In all, ""Barbie"" is an enjoyable movie, in the same way (for me) that ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" was unexpectedly enjoyable.""Barbie"" has been a critical and commercial smash since its release in theaters earlier this year. It is the top box office movie for 20232 (earning close to $1.5 billion (with a ""b"") worldwide. The movie started showing this weekend on HBO and streaming on Max, where I caught it.

The soundtrack is amazing including one of my favorite songs by billie eilish ""what was i made for."" The song is so amazing and finishes off the movie in the best way possible.Barbie took a very unexpected turn of events that did not appear in the trailer (i think this is a good thing) and was full of plot twists that thickened the storyline.It is great for all ages and genders as it has a lot of relatable characters.Overall i think it is a movie to definitely add to your watchlist and go see in your nearest cinema!!",so so so good,i love movi much it effortlessli funni end heartfelt quit sad the soundtrack amaz includ one favorit song billi eilish made the song amaz finish movi best way possiblebarbi took unexpect turn event appear trailer think good thing full plot twist thicken storylineit great age gender lot relat charactersoveral think movi definit add watchlist go see nearest cinema
"Surprises You, Entertains You","One might think this is a girly movie made for teenage girls and may be the early 20s. It starts off misleading the audience into a fun filled ride of jokes and conscious silliness at the start. Later, as we all settle into the Barbie world, it slides in Feministic conversations. At one point you think whether it's an adaptation of ""Men are from Mars..."" book, because they hit you deeper than the laugh you make of the dialogue.The subtext I gather is, the film is about a rich good looking girl who is living her hunky dory life where everything is spik and span. This girl has been metaphored as the Barbie. The girl who understands little of the real world until life hits her with ugly truth (revealed at the end) and she starts feeling real pain and emotions. At first she denies it and fights it and also gets it all back for a brief moment. Later she realizes, she wants to live real and wants to let go of the made up cocoon of beauty, perfection and pink.Entertaining, fresh and perfect Sunday morning watch to setup for an interesting discussion later in the evening.",surpris you entertain you,one might think girli movi made teenag girl may earli it start mislead audienc fun fill ride joke consciou silli start later settl barbi world slide feminist convers at one point think whether adapt men mar book hit deeper laugh make dialogueth subtext i gather film rich good look girl live hunki dori life everyth spik span thi girl metaphor barbi the girl understand littl real world life hit ugli truth reveal end start feel real pain emot at first deni fight also get back brief moment later realiz want live real want let go made cocoon beauti perfect pinkentertain fresh perfect sunday morn watch setup interest discus later even
"8,5/10","No movie I've seen lately has made me feel this happy. I went to the theater thinking I was going to see an ordinary romantic comedy, but as I watched the movie I started to think about what popular culture has done to people. The costumes are exquisite. The location designs are incredible. Makeup and jewelry design is perfect. And the acting is so natural that it draws you into the movie. A movie for the summer months. You feel incredibly happy when you leave the movie and go home. You are in a fairy tale world but you are facing the harshest realities of the world. I thank everyone who contributed. I hope that the interest in the movie will not lead to a repeat of the mistakes that have been made many times before and a second Barbie movie will not be made.",,no movi ive seen late made feel happi i went theater think i go see ordinari romant comedi i watch movi i start think popular cultur done peopl the costum exquisit the locat design incred makeup jewelri design perfect and act natur draw movi a movi summer month you feel incred happi leav movi go home you fairi tale world face harshest realiti world i thank everyon contribut i hope interest movi lead repeat mistak made mani time second barbi movi made
Stereotypical Barbie becomes a martyr for DEI Barbieland,"When things start going awry in Barbieland, it is up to 'stereotypical Barbie' (blonde hair, blue eyed version) to reset the matriarchal pieces in the perfect plastic world that represents everyone equally...or slightly less equal (if inverse to reality were offsetting). While Robbie is an idealistic Barbie, Gosling's charismatic nature completely directs attention away from Margot anytime the two share frame - it really does become the Ken movie for much of the second act as Gosling's character dominates the screen.Of course, this is all the plot oversimplified to its core. The moments of unabashed humor, and there is lots of it, speak for Gerwig's witted personality...unfortunately the preachy tone carried throughout the movie also does too. The film has its moments, even if the ending leaves some viewers indifferent. It's probably worth the watch if you just want a few chuckles and nothing more.",stereotyp barbi becom martyr dei barbieland,when thing start go awri barbieland stereotyp barbi blond hair blue eye version reset matriarch piec perfect plastic world repres everyon equallyor slightli le equal invers realiti offset while robbi idealist barbi gosl charismat natur complet direct attent away margot anytim two share frame realli becom ken movi much second act gosl charact domin screenof cours plot oversimplifi core the moment unabash humor lot speak gerwig wit personalityunfortun preachi tone carri throughout movi also the film moment even end leav viewer indiffer it probabl worth watch want chuckl noth
"I just wanted a to see a fun Barbie movie, not feel depressed","How did I go to watch Barbie, only to have seen a mildly depressing unecessarily deep movie saturated with politics and talk of mental health. The plot made no sense.For someone who has grown up and loved watching all the classics, it was a disappointment. Most women like to watch feel-good chick flicks as an escape from reality, and for the same reason, girls like to watch Barbie. But it was nothing like that, and instead I left the cinema feeling LITERALLY depressed. As a little girl, not a single part of me thought the old Barbie movies presented a Barbie who wasn't a strong figure. And yes, you can be strong, WHILE being in love.The way the movie was filmed was truly a work of art, but the plot made NO sense despite them trying to constantly spoon-feed it to us.In Barbie land the women (the barbies) are in charge and have everything while the men (the Kens) are nobodies with absolutely no power and are treated like nobodies. They dont even have houses. When Barbie enters the real word, she realises its the complete reverse. You'd think that Barbie would then REALISE that how she was being treated is how the barbies were treating the kens, then go back to Barbie land and FIX it. Instead, when she goes back to see Ken turning Barbie-land into Ken-land (because the poor sod had a taste of what it feels like to be appreciated when he was in the real world), she has a crisis and then gathers the barbies to MANIPULATE the kens into FIGHTING each other so they can take back their power. Then instead of apologising to Ken (who was genuinely in love with her and had no TRUE bad intentions the entire movie - he thought the patriarchy was about horses) about how she constantly brushed him off like an annoying child every 5 seconds, she simply apologises for not spending some time with him, then continues to reject him and tells him he essentially needs to FIND himself. Then she wants to become human despite fighting to maintain her perfection throughout the movie, simply because someone told her its ok to be imperfect - and I get what they're trying to achieve here but I thought there would be a deeper reason? Perhaps there are things about being an imperfect human that are valuable? Such as having empathy, or maybe make it obvious that she was becoming a more realistic role model for little girls by becoming human with cellulite?I get the intention of the movie, but it really didn't have to be that deep? I REALLY just wanted to have fun at a Barbie movie. The last thing you'd want to go watch after a long day at work or school is a movie about a silly fight between men and women, politics, patriarchy, death, depression and anxiety. The beginning of the film was fun, but that fun didn't last long. But people are probably gonna call us the brainwashed barbies because we actually want men to be our equals.",i want see fun barbi movi feel depress,how i go watch barbi seen mildli depress unecessarili deep movi satur polit talk mental health the plot made sensefor someon grown love watch classic disappoint most woman like watch feelgood chick flick escap realiti reason girl like watch barbi but noth like instead i left cinema feel liter depress a littl girl singl part thought old barbi movi present barbi wasnt strong figur and ye strong while loveth way movi film truli work art plot made no sen despit tri constantli spoonfe usin barbi land woman barbi charg everyth men ken nobodi absolut power treat like nobodi they dont even hous when barbi enter real word realis complet revers youd think barbi would realis treat barbi treat ken go back barbi land fix instead goe back see ken turn barbieland kenland poor sod tast feel like appreci real world crisi gather barbi manipul ken fight take back power then instead apologis ken genuin love true bad intent entir movi thought patriarchi hors constantli brush like annoy child everi second simpli apologis spend time continu reject tell essenti need find then want becom human despit fight maintain perfect throughout movi simpli someon told ok imperfect i get theyr tri achiev i thought would deeper reason perhap thing imperfect human valuabl such empathi mayb make obviou becom realist role model littl girl becom human cellulitei get intent movi realli didnt deep i realli want fun barbi movi the last thing youd want go watch long day work school movi silli fight men woman polit patriarchi death depress anxieti the begin film fun fun didnt last long but peopl probabl gon na call u brainwash barbi actual want men equal
So Much Fun,"I completely enjoyed Greta Gerwig's outstanding movie Barbie. It was delightful to see on the big screen with the great soundtrack and the eye-popping colors. Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie and she made a great movie even better.Someone asked why a 60+ adult female like me would go to see this kids movie.For me, Barbie was such a huge part of my childhood. Playing ""Barbs"" with my best friend as a young girl is one of my most cherished memories. It was something just for girls when we were mostly excluded from being in any lead role in the world (our moms, aunts, grandma's were excluded too). No sports, few female leads in film or television, few jobs outside of the pink collar ghetto we were kept in. Barbie was beautiful and the center of her own story. For this reason I had to go on opening weekend to vote for the world of Barbie, to say,
thank you.",so much fun,i complet enjoy greta gerwig outstand movi barbi it delight see big screen great soundtrack eyepop color margot robbi born play barbi made great movi even bettersomeon ask adult femal like would go see kid moviefor barbi huge part childhood play barb best friend young girl one cherish memori it someth girl mostli exclud lead role world mom aunt grandma exclud no sport femal lead film televis job outsid pink collar ghetto kept barbi beauti center stori for reason i go open weekend vote world barbi say thank
It was more than kenough,"The Barbie movie is a mixture of comedy and an analysis of an old era idea, using scenery that rivals classics like Playtime, and a cast that was clearly hand-picked with stars like Margot Gosling and Farrell. The movie features an astonishing soundtrack, including Ice Spice, Dua Lipa, Tame Impala, Billie, and much more. Barbie's presentation is top-notch, and some might even say it couldn't be any better (I would've agreed). However, the writing itself doesn't quite match its other impressive traits. Despite adapting the boring and monotonous toy line into something actually interesting on the big screen, it felt throughout the movie that the ideas of the writers were too disjointed. This led the director to piece together a self-exploration story with a modern world outlook, topped with media manipulation and a critique of society from a male perspective, with a side dish of a womanly critique of society. Safe to say, not every point got across as intended.The plot starts in Barbie Land, where we witness Robbie's character's journey and her existential quest. Concerned for her designated child's fate due to the villainous scholiosis, the tall blonde takes action. The movie's second part shifts to real-life segments, offering hilarious situations with Ken & Barbie. The perfect doll believes she's found her child but faces an unwelcome surprise, realizing the world is the opposite of her magical land; nobody admires loving Barbies, and the Kens are the ones in control. In contrast, the muscular blonde embraces and reshapes his former land into a fratboy utopia. After finding her true partner in the child's mother and returning to Barbie Land, the toy discovers its destruction under a horse-loving, Mojo Dojo Casa House Living, and beer-drinking government. With a pep talk from her former playmate, she learns about womanhood and reclaims her home using girl power.And this, without the inclusion of Matel and the ending. It tries to reach for the stars with the juggling of three major themes, but it has the wings of Icarus, represented by its 2-hour runtime.The main three themes are the search for one's self, the media prying on those who are deeply insecure, and the question of womanhood's position in society. However, not all themes were treated equally. The search for one's self, for example, had a great realization with the protagonist slowly becoming different from the others, becoming weird as the movie put it, and ending with the pursuit of reality, not succumbing to a safe bubble but embracing the truth fully. On the other hand, the theme of womanhood feels somewhat forced in the end, taking away from the main conflict.The movie starts the process of exploring this theme with the conflict between Barbie and the child of her owner, showing that Barbie isn't as glorious as she felt. However, after this, nothing truly develops. The kid joins the journey and sees that Barbie is a woman just like her, which doesn't really correlate with anything before that. To be honest, it feels more like a relatable moment rather than an actual thing, but I guess that is what solves the big Kenland problem. The middle ground gets taken by the character arc of Ken, and his performance steals the show, but the way it's solved pretty much trivializes the issue Ken was facing, making it an unsatisfying ending that boils down to 'Men are big dumb-dumbs' is extremely unfortunate, as it was, in my opinion, the most interesting part of the movie. However, you can't really rival 'I am just Ken' part.Something even more unfortunate was Farrell's character. He's such a good actor, but he was incredibly wasted in this role. I understand that it's a Barbie movie and kids will be there, and making the man in the suit dumb will make hilarious jokes for toddles. However, couldn't they you know, not put Farrell? His role doesn't really scream expertise, and other than that, they aren't even plot-relevant. I feel like if they just cut this part entirely, the movie would have had a lot more to gain. Besides, the movie is PG-13, so they don't really need to consider slapstick comedy (sorry for offending Mr. Bean Fans).In conclusion, the Barbie movie is surprisingly more than Ken-ough. It provides an amazing soundtrack and even better performances. However, it didn't deliver that well in its plot points. I wouldn't say it's a must-see, but you might be missing out if you don't watch it.",it kenough,the barbi movi mixtur comedi analysi old era idea use sceneri rival classic like playtim cast clearli handpick star like margot gosl farrel the movi featur astonish soundtrack includ ice spice dua lipa tame impala billi much barbi present topnotch might even say couldnt better i wouldv agre howev write doesnt quit match impress trait despit adapt bore monoton toy line someth actual interest big screen felt throughout movi idea writer disjoint thi led director piec togeth selfexplor stori modern world outlook top medium manipul critiqu societi male perspect side dish womanli critiqu societi safe say everi point got across intendedth plot start barbi land wit robbi charact journey existenti quest concern design child fate due villain scholiosi tall blond take action the movi second part shift reallif segment offer hilari situat ken barbi the perfect doll believ she found child face unwelcom surpris realiz world opposit magic land nobodi admir love barbi ken one control in contrast muscular blond embrac reshap former land fratboy utopia after find true partner child mother return barbi land toy discov destruct horselov mojo dojo casa hous live beerdrink govern with pep talk former playmat learn womanhood reclaim home use girl powerand without inclus matel end it tri reach star juggl three major theme wing icaru repres hour runtimeth main three theme search one self medium pri deepli insecur question womanhood posit societi howev theme treat equal the search one self exampl great realiz protagonist slowli becom differ other becom weird movi put end pursuit realiti succumb safe bubbl embrac truth fulli on hand theme womanhood feel somewhat forc end take away main conflictth movi start process explor theme conflict barbi child owner show barbi isnt gloriou felt howev noth truli develop the kid join journey see barbi woman like doesnt realli correl anyth to honest feel like relat moment rather actual thing i guess solv big kenland problem the middl ground get taken charact arc ken perform steal show way solv pretti much trivial issu ken face make unsatisfi end boil men big dumbdumb extrem unfortun opinion interest part movi howev cant realli rival i ken partsometh even unfortun farrel charact he good actor incred wast role i understand barbi movi kid make man suit dumb make hilari joke toddl howev couldnt know put farrel hi role doesnt realli scream expertis arent even plotrelev i feel like cut part entir movi would lot gain besid movi pg dont realli need consid slapstick comedi sorri offend mr bean fansin conclus barbi movi surprisingli kenough it provid amaz soundtrack even better perform howev didnt deliv well plot point i wouldnt say mustse might miss dont watch
Not as hyped imo,"As another reviewer said, strong start. I thought I was going to love this based upon the first 20 minutes. Then after that there just seemed like so many missed opportunities for funnier moments. Missed opportunities for moments with what they were trying to convey. Many missed opportunities for comedy in Barbieland & in the ""real"" world!! It just seemed like it could have been better. One of the only funny moments was the rollerblading which everyone's seen in previews & trailers. Two of the only emotional moments was Barbie sitting next to a very old woman & when she cries after what the young girls at the table in school tell her. It could have been great between her & Ken (even if they only stayed friends I'm not saying that because they didn't end up ""in love"" ) but they just make him out to be nothing but a buffoon even at the end. No wonder if men don't like this. Although I'm all for women empowerment with or without a man especially with a daughter. I just don't think you have to discard men as such fools to do so, that only divides us...Even the big speech about women at the end that America Ferrera did really wasn't all that & could have been said even better.Kens character was a joke. I don't like how things ended for him. They could have made weird Barbie funnier as well as utilized more past Barbies better than they did. Will Ferrell who I normally like was so lame in this, not really his fault given his lines. Visually it was great. I like how they brought in Rhea Perlman as Ruth. I was just hoping for so much more. Like leaving me with a good or even bad feeling. Something. I really had about as much feeling when this movie was over as any bad comedy I catch on tv. It was made out to be like there was some big point or message. I was actually avoiding watching it until I was in the mood to be blown away, for something emotional.

It's a satire,"The long-awaited and well-publicized Barbie movie is a way for Mattel to apologize for the mistakes they made, to achieve greater acceptance of the new generations, trying to imply that they are going to change those mistakes, but doing it in the best way. Form of advertising possible. Visually it is a colorful and striking film, which reminds us of many Barbie ester eggs, recalling many things from childhood (I was never really a Barbie fan). It is a friendly film for adults and children, I think that each age group will understand according to
be age. I knew that it couldn't be a bad movie since it has a very good director, luckily they decided to change the initial actress since the movie would be another story. It is a criticism using humor, about feminism, machismo, patriarchy, about what women face (I had never thought that Barbie was nominated by women, however her mistake was wanting perfectionism), about existential doubts, the world dominated by men on many occasions, the relationships of mothers and adolescents, the daily routine, trying not to fall into this routine and procrastinate, I think it is a film that, being well analyzed, has very good components and a very good plot, something that one never imagined from a movie about Barbie.",it satir,the longawait wellpublic barbi movi way mattel apolog mistak made achiev greater accept new gener tri impli go chang mistak best way form advertis possibl visual color strike film remind u mani barbi ester egg recal mani thing childhood i never realli barbi fan it friendli film adult child i think age group understand accord age i knew couldnt bad movi sinc good director luckili decid chang initi actress sinc movi would anoth stori it critic use humor femin machismo patriarchi woman face i never thought barbi nomin woman howev mistak want perfection existenti doubt world domin men mani occas relationship mother adolesc daili routin tri fall routin procrastin i think film well analyz good compon good plot someth one never imagin movi barbi
Barbie,"I took my twin daughters to go see this film at the movie theaters with me this weekend. They are 11 and they seemed to enjoy it. The film is geared much to a older crowd, which helped keep them entertained as well as the adults that were in the theater as well. Margot Robbie was great as Barbie she did very good in that role. I love how the film put a modern twist on how people are these days in society- dealing with social anxiety and other disorders. Yet it tells the story of why Barbie was initially invented to began with and what Barbie and Ken stood for.

Loved it!,"Barbie comes to life and is surprised by all the possibilities after a life pre-determined. She goes on an adventure in the real world with new friend Madeline. The film celebrates finding oneself and believing in one's potential, with Barbie learning there is no single path laid out and she has the power to write her own story. The film takes Barbie out of her traditional Dreamhouse setting and puts her in the real world for the first time. This allows her to experience what life has to offer beyond what she was perhaps accustomed to. Visually the film looks colorful and upbeat with a focus on Barbie's journey of self-discovery in a real world setting she's unfamiliar with.",love,barbi come life surpris possibl life predetermin she goe adventur real world new friend madelin the film celebr find oneself believ one potenti barbi learn singl path laid power write stori the film take barbi tradit dreamhous set put real world first time thi allow experi life offer beyond perhap accustom visual film look color upbeat focu barbi journey selfdiscoveri real world set she unfamiliar
Legally blonde 3,"With Barbie, we embark on a journey that feels oddly reminiscent of the ""Legally Blonde"" series. While the movie is fun and aims to champion the empowerment of women, it somewhat stumbles on the path of originality.Greta Gerwig, the director, rather gratuitously employs an iconic character, and it's hard to shake off the feeling that we've been here before. The film's attempt to convey a message about empowerment is evident, but it leans on well-trodden ground. In doing so, Barbie risks oversimplification and perhaps even underestimates the intelligence of its audience, particularly young women.It's undeniably an enjoyable watch, sprinkled with moments of humor and amusement. However, in the grand scheme of filmmaking, it doesn't quite etch itself as a milestone. In the realm of female empowerment, we're at a stage where narratives should be as diverse and complex as the women they aim to celebrate.Barbie, while entertaining, missed the opportunity to break new ground. The reliance on a very simple movie formula might resonate with some, but it leaves others yearning for a more profound and innovative exploration of what it truly means to empower women on the big screen.In a cinematic landscape that craves originality and depth, Barbie's attempt is a step in the right direction but falls short of being a transformative force in the portrayal of female empowerment. As we navigate the evolving narratives of women in film, there's an expectation for stories that break away from the conventional, offering a richer and more nuanced perspective.",legal blond,with barbi embark journey feel oddli reminisc legal blond seri while movi fun aim champion empower woman somewhat stumbl path originalitygreta gerwig director rather gratuit employ icon charact hard shake feel weve the film attempt convey messag empower evid lean welltrodden ground in barbi risk oversimplif perhap even underestim intellig audienc particularli young womenit undeni enjoy watch sprinkl moment humor amus howev grand scheme filmmak doesnt quit etch mileston in realm femal empower stage narr diver complex woman aim celebratebarbi entertain miss opportun break new ground the relianc simpl movi formula might reson leav other yearn profound innov explor truli mean empow woman big screenin cinemat landscap crave origin depth barbi attempt step right direct fall short transform forc portray femal empower a navig evolv narr woman film there expect stori break away convent offer richer nuanc perspect
Simple message beautifully told,"I enjoyed this film very much even if I didn't learn anything new - because I'm old enough. But I would love it if I gad some movie like this to watch during my teenage days.Direction was impeccable, cast amazingly well chosen, scenography immaculate, as well as makeup and costume. Storytelling was absolutely superb.Serious issues were told in a very innovative manner and philosophically it is highly important film because of all the antagonisms. It doesn't offer a solution, and with an excellent reason - the answers are in each of us.Absolutely brilliant work and I would watch it again many times. (In contrast to Oppenheimer which was biggest bore of all the time)This comes from a person who never liked playing with Barbie(s).",simpl messag beauti told,i enjoy film much even i didnt learn anyth new im old enough but i would love i gad movi like watch teenag daysdirect impecc cast amazingli well chosen scenographi immacul well makeup costum storytel absolut superbseri issu told innov manner philosoph highli import film antagon it doesnt offer solut excel reason answer usabsolut brilliant work i would watch mani time in contrast oppenheim biggest bore timethi come person never like play barbi
Bright Pink Fun,Barbie is basically exactly what we need right now. A hilarious summer blockbuster with a social commentary nuanced enough to allow young ones to enjoy but present enough for you to get something out of it. Margot Robbie is brilliant and a perfect Barbie. Gosling shows off his incredible comedic talent more than ever.Most all the jokes land well. It's clear that the actors understood Gerwig's vision and Gerwig and Baumbach's script. Set and costume design are on another level in Barbie. The distinction between Barbieland and the real world is done very well thanks to set design.See Barbie!,bright pink fun,barbi basic exactli need right a hilari summer blockbust social commentari nuanc enough allow young one enjoy present enough get someth margot robbi brilliant perfect barbi gosl show incred comed talent evermost joke land well it clear actor understood gerwig vision gerwig baumbach script set costum design anoth level barbi the distinct barbieland real world done well thank set designse barbi

A wonderful surprise!,"I went to see this one with my 11 year old daughter, thinking that it would be a movie directed to kids. It's not! Actually, it's one of the best social satires I have seen and many jokes and references will be difficult or even impossible to understand for kids. They'll still be having a good time, but it's the adults that are actually in for the big treat. I absolutely loved it and recommend this to everyone who loves a clever satire with a lot of heart and mesmerizing cinematography.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are perfect in their roles, the script/story is engaging, funny but also very touching at times and the overall result is delightful.You'll find yourself wanting to own this one in your collection, it really is that good.",a wonder surpris,i went see one year old daughter think would movi direct kid it actual one best social satir i seen mani joke refer difficult even imposs understand kid theyll still good time adult actual big treat i absolut love recommend everyon love clever satir lot heart mesmer cinematographymargot robbi ryan gosl perfect role scriptstori engag funni also touch time overal result delightfulyoul find want one collect realli good
Amazing Barbie Land Along With A Uneven Plot and Direction,"This uneven portrayal of a live Barbie doll played by Margot Robbie along with Ryan Gosling as Ken creates a Mattel movie with heart that hits some nice emotional notes. Will Ferrell has the unfortunate casting as Mattel's CEO in a role that slapstick comedy that comes across at odds and does not play well either in the real world or Barbie Land, like an out of place reformed Wile E. Coyote from the old Road Runner animation (1966-73). The opening Barbie Land scenario seems to go on for too long and the intriguing opportunity for Barbie to experience the real world seems too short as well as the divided focus between the real life mother and daughter and their experiences as well as the daughter's feelings which seemed to evolve too suddenly. While the Barbie Land sets are amazingly cute and the acting in Barbie Land had a dazzling sense of toy land fascination, the overall intriguing plot seemed somehow dated and underdeveloped even for young kids today. The movie as a whole had sufficient freshness of style, Margot Robbie's impressive acting, and a dramatic plot sufficient to retain marginal sustained interest to watch the move all the way through to the end to warrant a summer vacation land of entertainment for two hours.",amaz barbi land along with a uneven plot direct,thi uneven portray live barbi doll play margot robbi along ryan gosl ken creat mattel movi heart hit nice emot note will ferrel unfortun cast mattel ceo role slapstick comedi come across odd play well either real world barbi land like place reform wile e coyot old road runner anim the open barbi land scenario seem go long intrigu opportun barbi experi real world seem short well divid focu real life mother daughter experi well daughter feel seem evolv suddenli while barbi land set amazingli cute act barbi land dazzl sen toy land fascin overal intrigu plot seem somehow date underdevelop even young kid today the movi whole suffici fresh style margot robbi impress act dramat plot suffici retain margin sustain interest watch move way end warrant summer vacat land entertain two hour
Could Woulda Shoulda,"Alas, my high hopes were crushed. When i heard about this project, I saw the opportunity, and expected, rather hoped for, an utterly ridiculous over the top comedy where dollified actors could come up with some novel situations. I wanted to see what kind of comedic chops Gosling would trot out. Instead, after a razzmatazz showbiz intro, dancing dolls and high energy, the sad, busy, and quizzical plot unfolds as a very sorry melodrama. An emotionally vulnerable and beautiful but pitiful Barbie, and a truly oafish Ken, have passed through a ""Dimensional Membrane"" onto the earth plane, into a reality just as bizarre and unrealistic as the Barbie-Dimension, and the two doll-humanoids find themselves maladaptive and disliked, even persecuted. And they have come looking for a solution to an unpleasant sort of problem. This just isn't funny. It's pretty much a reworking of Judy Garland in OZ, way out of her element, trying to find the Ruby Slippers. In fact, it was a deformation of her feet as a Doll in Barbieland, that kicks off this whole sorry setup. Now I have to ask myself why I was expecting a comedy? Well, because the advertising suggested something ludicrous. When you see Will Ferrell doing pratfalls and the entire surreal pink Landscape of Barbie Land, Gosling with idiotic facial expressions and gestures, and Barbie presented as a very sexualized Super-Bimbo, sort of a witless Mae West, (who was very witty), I thought some very funny stuff was coming down the pike. Nope. I wouldn't say avoid it, but I would say it never really finds it's tone, and doesn't live up to its advertised premise. The crowd around me wanted to laugh, that was clear, and was struggling to find something funny in things that just weren't. This must have cost a fortune to produce.

Plastic & Fantastic,"Taking the joy and levity of the Mattel dynasty that is Barbie, and throwing the perfect figure into real world social issues creates an excellent fish-out-of-water plot. Addressing gender issues in a bright and (mostly) light-hearted manner gives the film an excellent moral without becoming preachy. Anyone vehemently against messages transmitted in the film must have strong opinions on whether these issues are a reality, as there is nothing controversial here, just a doll tackling common sense.Success comes from the film's perfect casting. Robbie could not be bettered, with a positive and bubbly attitude wonderfully transitioning through something as dark as an existential crisis. Even issues around her character supposedly losing her beauty are brilliantly maneuvered through some excellent fourth-wall breaking.Gosling leans into the camp brainlessness of his Ken to create a persona both lovable and problematic, but most importantly hilarious. The wider cast is star-studded, the roster of Barbies and Kens including the likes of McKinnon, Liu and Cera, with real-world characters from Ferrera and Ferrell. All this added to with ridiculous cameos throughout.Brilliantly funny, the dialogue and comedy can range from deadpan to daft depending on the scenario. Easter eggs are thrown in throughout and even those without an interest in the doll growing up can at least appreciate the references on show.Fantastic costuming and props, the brightness of Barbieland is joyous to see and so perfectly contrasted with in the real world.

Kenough,"Synopsis: Barbie (Played by Margot Robbie) suddenly starts to notice that she is slowly turning away from being the stereotypical Barbie doll with a few changes happening to her. This forces Barbie to discover the real world as well as herself and her purpose as a doll.This film is directed by Greta Gerwig and written by both Greta Gerwig and her partner Noah Baumbach. In case you did not know, Greta Gerwig is the writer and director of films like Lady Bird (2017) and Little Woman (2018). Both these films are astonishing in terms of the screenplay and dialogues. In addition, Noah Baumbach wrote, directed, and produced Marriage Story (2019) as well as Frances Ha (2012) that had Greta Gerwig as a lead actress role and a writer in the film. Both those films also stood out for mostly the screenplay that is very deep and realistic in terms of the story and dialogues. Therefore, the expectations of Barbie are very high especially that we are talking about having those big names as the filmmakers behind this film. However, the results are unfortunately not near their previous films, especially in-terms of the screenplay.Barbie is a film that is in my opinion targeted mostly for adults. It is like the director described, ""a party for everyone, and everyone is invited"". But, young kids (especially today's new young generation) will feel like it's not the type of party for them. As well as the jokes that feel like mostly adults will get them, especially that some of them include some inappropriate language or idea.The biggest flaws of the film are its most important parts, and the main story mainly evolves around them. Therefore, because they weren't done well, the film lost its balance at most times. Barbie touched on the topic of how a relationship between a mother and a daughter can be and the stages it goes through. This is being portrayed in the weakest way ever and that's due to many reasons mainly for not giving it enough time and discussing it very briefly. Therefore, no emotions or connections are created between both the mother's character and the daughter's character with audience members. As well as, using a young actress to portray the role of the daughter that can be played by someone else with better acting skills. Without spoiling, but, a shorter sequence near the end of the film between 2 irrelevant characters, was able to touch audience members' hearts in terms of that topic, better than the characters of the mother and daughter with their sequences that we spent nearly most of the film with trying to connect with their relationship. A huge aspect that had helped in making this sequence a successful one is Billie Eilish's song ""What was I made for"" that was playing in the background during it. I an interview wit Billie, she goes by explaining how this song tells what she went through and felt in an. This can be heard in the song's lyrics and Billie's voice that makes this scene and song very real and original and goes so well with that scene in particular.Another huge flaw is the portrait of the Mattel corporation with its executives, mainly played by Will Farrell as the CEO of Mattel. Very weak, and cringe at times that just made me rather want to go back to the BarbieLnad sequences or Barbie and Ke sequences.Margot Robbie is just phenomenal as Barbie exactly like what everyone expected her to be. She proves herself as an actress that can be added to the list of one of the most significant actresses in the modern time. She is able to play most roles very well and that can be seen from her previous roles like Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad (2016), Sharon Tate in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), or previously in Babylon (2022) as Nillie Lorey. On the other hand, Ryan gosling as Ken is shining in this film. I think most of the scenes that I laughed out loud in, where mostly because of jokes performed by Gosling with the help of his acting skills using facial expressions and body language that suits Ken's character and behaviour perfectly. Simu Lui proves himself in this film that he is better in comedy films rather than serious action drama films. I enjoyed his comedic Ken role here more tHan i enjoyed seeing him being a superhero and trying to play a character like Shang-Chu in marvel's Shang-Chi (2021).Greta really uses all the memes and trends that people have created in regards to the Barbie movie on the different social media platforms, and uses them as the main core behind the comedy aspect of the film. These little details are what make Greta's films all different from each other. Also, this is what makes Barbie a film made for the fans specifically. For instance, everyone have seen the meme that is a picture of the gang from Goodfellas wearing suits and looking very fresh, with a caption on it that says: ""4 tickets for the Barbie movie please"". This can clearly be seen in the film as many jokes had a similar idea that evolves around those jokes that you would end to your buddy on Tik Tok or Insta. One of my favourite lines said by Ryan Gosling's Ken is: ""Every night is boys' night"".Finally, props to all production design, custom design and editing team that was able to portray BarbieLand and all the different Barbie and Ken versions exactly how they were suppose to look with their pink and colourful world and customs which is a thing that I personally was worried about. The results are more than ""KENough""My rating is 8/10Watched on July 20th, 2023

"Robbie is perfection, Gosling is 'just okay'","Barbie begins in a bubble-gum-coloured world of fun, fashion and perfection. Although Barbie is played by dozens of actors, 'Stereotypical Barbie' is played by Margot Robbie. Perfection in Barbie land doesn't last long though, as Barbie must travel to the real world to solve her sudden existential crisis. She meets both friends and foes along the way.As Barbie and her new girl gang return to Barbie Land, they are horrified to see that it is now renamed 'Kendom', after Ken (Ryan Gosling) who initially tagged along with Barbie has discovered the patriarchy of the real world and wants to be seen as more than 'just Ken'.With a star-studded cast full of cameos, Barbie's Margot Robbie is stunning, and I think the perfect choice for the title role. On a side note, it was nice to hear her not doing a Boston/New York accent for once. Ryan Gosling however took me out of the Ken fantasy. Character-wise he was great, but I see Ken as more of a Travis Van Winkle or Trevor Donovan type. Goslings' portrayal of Ken looked a bit sleazy, and the bleach-blonde hair did him no favours.There is a lot of lore and fun easter eggs throughout the film that both young and old can recognize, and even if you don't have a history of playing with Barbies (which I cannot confirm or deny that I did), there is a sense of nostalgia too.Bonus points for the phenomenal set and costume design, and a killer soundtrack too! I'd be disappointed if this film isn't up for any major awards for the above-mentioned.Barbie was super fun!

Such a fun film,I love this film. It's so what we need right now. A bright and happy movie that makes you smile.The way people have embraced it is amazing. People dressing up to go and see it. It's so cleverly done. Margo Robbie is stunning and brilliant as Barbie. Ryan Gosling was the right pick for Ken. He has that cheeky charm and vulnerability down to a tee. He is such a great performer and dancer. If you ever had a Barbie this will bring back memories. It's got it's political undertones and it's trying to get a message across. But it's a film I think will be doing the rounds for a long time with the likes of Mamma Mia.,such fun film,i love film it need right a bright happi movi make smileth way peopl embrac amaz peopl dress go see it cleverli done margo robbi stun brilliant barbi ryan gosl right pick ken he cheeki charm vulner tee he great perform dancer if ever barbi bring back memori it got polit underton tri get messag across but film i think round long time like mamma mia
"A repetitive script, great acting though","I personally thought it would be exciting to watch but turns out it was not. I could already guess the rest of the movie by watching the first half. The only reason i kept going was the acting. Gosling and Robbie were great casts and they fit perfectly for the roles, but i didn't really like the rest of the cast, specially America Ferrera and Ariana Greenblatt. On the other hand, the way they staged Barbieland was amazing! Even though i'm not a big fan of bright colors i loved how they used the typical barbie pink everywhere.

Is this a comedy?,"I was just thinking about some of the funniest films I've ever seen, movies such as Airplane, Naked Gun, Monty Python, Groundhog Day, Caddyshack, National Lampoon and Austin Powers come to mind to name a few. This film does not fit in that list.The main issue here is that this film just isn't funny. There is not one joke that I can imagine anyone could find funny. The acting isn't great from anyone, and the script just seems strange and doesn't make much sense. It's like a cross between several different films and it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. The cast looks good on paper but it just doesn't deliver and I was relieved when the film was over as it feels like it lasts for about 6 hours.

You'll appreciate this 'life in plastic' film more than you can ever imagine. 💗,"Only Greta Gerwig can pull this movie off. She is the only one that can helm this movie right. No other directors can do what she did for this movie. Why? Because the others would end up making this movie as generic or as plain as possible aka 'just another commercial blockbuster movie'. Greta Gerwig was able to turn the wheels from the overly used direction, venturing into new territories most directors are afraid to go.Barbie the Movie sends out strong messages and contexts about a lot of different things. Some of them include patriarchy, male-dominated world, female-dominated world, perfectionism, teenage-phase life, adulting, gender equality, equity, sexual objectifications amongst many others. Now, you must be shocked to hear all of this are conveyed in this film. A Barbie film that talks about all this stuff? YES. This is Greta's X-Factor, having to bring these sensitive subjects into a movie for everyone catered for all audiences. And children will still be entertained and understood with the story and the messages that Barbie brings to the table.It is definitely not an easy job trying to recreate the world of Barbie and make it a reality. Life in plastic, the team has to build Barbie Land from scratch. Everything needs to look right; the environment, the designs and the outfits. And Greta and the team did their research and you can clearly see it from the movie. Everything just comes to life the way they are supposed to be. Everything is plastic and yet, it's gorgeously constructed. The atmosphere, mood and tone really give that Barbie Land vibes.You need to acknowledge that this is a very meta movie. While Warner Bros failed at doing this with The Matrix: Resurrections, Barbie the Movie is a whole different story. They did this justice! It is self-aware that this film is about toys, that toys are not living objects, that someone else is controlling the narrative and they use this opportunity to create a story around this meta-themed element and it works! It works so well because the film is carefully constructed and impeccably paced, knowing what to serve the audience, when to be self-aware and how to blend Barbie's storyline with all the meta together, making the film as a stand out compared to other similar themed features.Barbie the Movie, which prior to viewing, we thought that it was going all in for women empowerment. But it didn't. Instead, it's full with surprises that started off thinking it was going to be that but as the film progressed, it opened up to so many possibilities of perspectives and viewpoints because the story itself is not definite but subjective and timely. It touches on current issues that are important not only for women, but for men as well. It doesn't want to side with a certain group for people, what it wants is to get the message acroos right; to make sure that everyone gets the story they deserve.While the story unwraps, there are golden comedy moments of pop-culture references and sarcastic remarks that, if you knew what they're about, you'll be laughing because of how relatable it is with today's world or personal experiences OR because of you didn't expect that a film like this would have jokes so sarcastic. If you've ever played with any dolls or toys, if you always keep up with the news and if you truly understand what meta is, you'll get all the references.We had hoped when Ryan Gosling was casted as the main Ken. Well, we knew he was the perfect choice, to put it fair and square. His performance was good but because Margot Robbie was so freaking excellent and top-notch as the main Barbie, Gosling couldn't put his character on par with her, he overacted at times and the makeup department tried making him look young but the powder they put him on actually made him look the total opposite. If you'd asked, Glen Powell would have been a better choice as the stereotypical Ken. He suits as a blondie, originated from Texas, his six-pack is crunched as seen in Top Gun Maverick and he has great comedic timing, evidently from Scream Queens.Did at any time the message comes across as preachy? Holistically, no. But they did slip a bit somewhere at the end of 2nd act (middle) up until the beginning of 3rd act (finale) where it went a bit overboard. It became a bit 'on your face' and these scenes may be the reason that social media will explode with controversial discussions and arguments because of some viewers who feel threatened by the way the subjects are brought to the spotlight. We're all okay with this film but this bump they have makes it uneven from the remaining duration, in which everything is told very, very well.Almost everything with Barbie the Movie is great, even the tiniest elements. The colour palette plays a huge part in this movie, the dialogues know how to be impactful, the music is ear-soothing and the extras are just as important as the supporting, everyone actually plays a part in maintaining the mood of the film.Verdict: Filled with contexts and messages as rich as Oscar-nominated films, Barbie the Movie is a whole different game as it is full with surprises and hard-hitting truths about the world we live in today. It is self-aware of what it is and Greta Gerwig daringly takes charge of crafting a masterpiece storytelling that capitalizes on the heavy subjects without downgrading anything or anyone, maintaining both its quality and substance the entire film.

"Funny, but too many inside jokes","One must have a full understanding of American culture over the last 60 decades to really understand this film. The opening sequence, modeled after ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is extremely funny. And when Margot Robbie suddenly appears as ""Barbie,"" my first thought was: ""Now that is perfect casting.""The movie was fun, with some great laughs, and the idea that Barbie would have some kind of ""existential crisis"" was actually quite clever. That said, leaving Barbie's world and ""crossing over"" into the real world, which happened to be Los Angeles, near the Mattel Toy company headquarters, seemed strange to me. I felt like we were suddenly in a Mad TV show, and not a particularly funny episode.The closing song by Billie Eilish (""What Was I Made For"") is brilliant, and I'm not a B. E. fan. But this song was over-the-top brilliant.

WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SEEING????,"This is not a great movie - when you get down to it, it's not even a good movie. It's a popcorn movie at best. The best thing it has going for it? Margot Robbie as Barbie: she does channel the role well and when her world turns upside down, you genuinely feel sorry for her. At the other end of the scale - Ryan Gosling as Ken. Gosling is good at stretching into roles, but no matter what - Ken was an androgenous doll and Gosling can't stretch the role anything more than that. He looks like a character out of ZOOLANDER and whenever he is on the screen, i was cringing in my seat. There are definitely funny moments: my favorite? When Ken runs into the ocean to surf. Definitely a woman's movie from the first preach to the final cast roll - it got old fast and the screenplay didn't seem to have much substance after the ""I am woman"" speeches. I thought it was me, but there was a lot of kids in the theatre and they all appeared to be bored as well.

Cute movie,"This is the story of old doll Barbie (since many years ago but presented here as a young beautiful woman). She is suffering a crisis about herself and her existence and wants to go to the real world to have it solved. We see nice images from the real world and the Barbie's world and see several other Barbie doll types all along the movie. This story develops itself by a lot of conflicts mainly because at a certain time her lover Ken betrays her and tries to be the leader of Barbie's world which makes Barbie and her allies to fight him and his followers till the end in several intricate scenes till he is defeated and Barbie becomes a real woman with the help of Ruth, her creator.

A hand-crafted ball of serotonin,"Prepare to embark on a mesmerizing journey through the enchanting world of Barbie! This handcrafted ball of serotonin is an absolute delight, leaving your heart brimming with joy from start to finish. Trust me, my cheeks were hurting too, but it was a small price to pay for the unbridled happiness that ensued.In the magical realm of Barbieland, Oscar-worthy set designs work like portals, whisking you away to a realm of imagination and wonder. The chemistry between Margot and Ryan is nothing short of spectacular, radiating an irresistible charm that leaps off the screen and captures your heart.Beyond the surface, the film's plot weaves a tapestry of surprises, defying predictability with cunning twists that keep you guessing throughout. Amid the laughter, ""Barbie"" serves as a brilliant mirror, reflecting upon society's norms, dismantling stereotypes, and fearlessly confronting issues of gender inequality and toxic masculinity. Such clever social commentary adds depth and meaning to this seemingly carefree adventure.As for the comedy, prepare for a sidesplitting experience! Joke after joke lands perfectly, leaving you in stitches and gasping for breath. However, the true comedic gem is none other than Will Ferrel, who delivers a performance that leaves a lasting impression. With impeccable timing and wit, he steals the spotlight in every scene, creating comedic gold that will resonate with audiences of all ages.While the movie does wear the hat of a toy advertisement, it walks the tightrope adeptly. Balancing appeal to the younger audience with engaging entertainment for adults, ""Barbie"" strikes a perfect harmony that caters to both ends of the spectrum.With all the praise deservedly sung, there is only one minor drawback - the movie ends too soon!

Started well but ended badly,"Was thrilled at start. What with all the pinks and blues and wow the reference to "" Planet of the Apes"" and ""Thus spake Zarathustra"". Somehow Greta or the writer did not know how to proceed after the Ken takeover and ended it all with almost a Christian sermon, however feminist it may sound and gave an American ending of all's well. Had expected more.The actors were great. And after the overall hype of Barbieheimer, and of course having seen the Heimer part of it before it was insufficient for me to give a better score.

Get off your couch and go to Barbie Land!,"Storyline: 8.5- Great story, could've been fleshed out in some areas to have even more overall connection, but it makes overall sense. A little silly at times; but I'm not complaining, I mean it is a story about Barbie. Pacing was good and easy to follow. It is, in my opinion, the perfect movie length, at an hour and 54 minutes.Cinematography: 8.75- There are some really great cinematic shots throughout the film. Very clear distinction between ""Barbie Land"" and ""The Real World"".Acting- 9.75- The acting was wonderful. Every actor pulled their weight and shined. Many comedic moments that will have you laughing nearly to tears. Also, There are serious moments that are executed well in such a way that may even bring you to tears (as they did to me).Music Music Soundtrack: 9.5- Overall, extremely strong movie music soundtrack. All of the songs align with the theme of what is happening during the current scenes & the storyline. Great modern day popular artists chosen, including Lizzo, Dua Lippa, Nicki Minaj, Ice Spice, Sam Smith, Tame Impala, and others. The weakest song (and I mean from a vocal standpoint) is the one sung by Ryan Gosling.Choreography- 9- There is a fair amount of choreography in the film, and there is an all-Ken dancing scene that is phenomenal.Overall: 9.1/10.",get couch go barbi land,storylin great stori couldv flesh area even overal connect make overal sen a littl silli time im complain i mean stori barbi pace good easi follow it opinion perfect movi length hour minutescinematographi there realli great cinemat shot throughout film veri clear distinct barbi land the real worldact the act wonder everi actor pull weight shine mani comed moment laugh nearli tear also there seriou moment execut well way may even bring tear memus music soundtrack overal extrem strong movi music soundtrack all song align theme happen current scene storylin great modern day popular artist chosen includ lizzo dua lippa nicki minaj ice spice sam smith tame impala other the weakest song i mean vocal standpoint one sung ryan goslingchoreographi there fair amount choreographi film allken danc scene phenomenaloveral
Ryan Gosling was capping on his life,"First things first, what was good about this movie. There was no better choice for Barbie than Margot Robbie she's lovely and brilliant. Ryan is also Kenough.Set design is amazing. Musical aspect of this movie is well done, but that's it. Other than this, the movie is mediocre at best. And certainly doesn't live up to what was promised. The biggest letdown was the script, it is trying to be something more even though it's not. If they just stick to comedy instead trying to make this story deep and powerful which makes it dump because it's poorly done and stupid. I understand were was Greta Gerwing aiming at, but why so preachy why so forced. The thing is this movie takes itself so serious at one time and then not so much at another making it a mess. I think if they just stick to the musical comedy aspect instead of overly complicated dramedy, they could have got away with it.Overall this isn't the worst movie ever, it's still above average, the direction is good, the actors is good, everything looks good. But you will probably forget it on the way out.",ryan gosl cap life,first thing first good movi there better choic barbi margot robbi she love brilliant ryan also kenoughset design amaz music aspect movi well done that other movi mediocr best and certainli doesnt live promis the biggest letdown script tri someth even though if stick comedi instead tri make stori deep power make dump poorli done stupid i understand greta gerw aim preachi forc the thing movi take seriou one time much anoth make mess i think stick music comedi aspect instead overli complic dramedi could got away itoveral isnt worst movi ever still averag direct good actor good everyth look good but probabl forget way
Bait-and-Switch Barbie,"Summary: This isn't the fun, light-hearted fantasy the marketing would have you believe. It is instead a clunky film that is nearly all social commentary. In fact, the plot and protagonist of the film is the patriarchy and more specifically men. The result is a sexist film that can be good at times but frustrating for many viewers. The movie may even be damaging to woman (explanation below).Full Review:I will justify my summary above but I want to first share that the film has a tremendous amount of potential and that I will be looking forward to a sequel should it come out. The cast is excellent. Gosling absolutely steals the show and is clearly having a ton of fun. Robbie is also a gem and is the quintessential Barbie. They could not have picked a better cast. The set design was fun and probably exactly what you would hope for in a Barbie film. The tempo was great, the cameos were fun, the movie was appropriately self-aware, the humor generally landed well. It's probably not a kids movie and I think that I wouldn't want my kids to attend it do to the adult humor and the social commentary bit. I think that for the right audiences the social commentary might elicit some good discussions and may be interesting to some.I don't mind social commentary but I'd prefer to know that its in the film before I go. If I do go see a movie with social commentary its not generally as clunky as the movie Barbie is. For example, after the movie I asked several people what they thought was the message of the movie and no one person had the same answer. Surely the message centers around feminism or woman's empowerment. These are themes that generally everyone can get behind but the movie isn't clear on specifics. Does the movie intend to convey that Barbie is problematic as a doll or symbol? Is the movie suggesting the patriarchy is a problem? Is it that woman can do anything they put their mind to it? Is it saying the diversity is important? Basically... the movie fails to pinpoint what exactly it is trying to comment on.Generally if you go see a movie that is intended to be social commentary then you should come out of it with thought provoking questions and ideas. It should be a movie that ""flips the script"" so that if you are on the opposite side of an issue you become more aware/informed after watching the movie. Unfortunately Barbie doesn't do this. Barbie lives in a fantasy world but the real world n the film is also a fantasy. She doesn't face any real world or realistic dilemma causing us to evaluate the gender systems we have in place. Even the times Barbie is subjected to discrimination or sexism (which is fairly constant) these times are not realistic or believable. Thus the commentary comes off as preachy and anecdotal.Barbie is also not a role model or a hero in the movie. It's weird watching a movie that is written to empower woman while also featuring a weak and sexist female lead. The film begins with Barbie dismissing men and being biased towards woman. I don't want to leave any spoilers but.... SEMI-SPOILER... the movie ends with things being unequal between the sexes. As a result the film almost suggests that the sexes shouldn't be treated equally. In other words, its clear Barbie and Barbie the movie believes females are the superior gender.Moreover, Barbie is not a strong and powerful woman. We are told in the movie that Barbie is an inspiration to woman fairly constantly. Normally I would agree. But the Barbie in this movie is depicted as uncapable and weak. She is egocentric and motivated by a desire to be beautiful. In fact, the entire plot kicks off because she finds cellulite on her legs and it later revolves around her self-centered interests to maintain power in her community. Its hard to relate or feel sympathetic under these circumstances and if anything the plot is an indictment on woman's (and societies) overuse of beauty and sexuality. As Barbie trots along her path she doesn't overcome anything on her own and she doesn't change as a person. In fact, everything she ""accomplishes"" is because someone told her what to do or because someone else did something for her. Not one time can I recall did Barbie accomplish something on her own or reevaluate her positions. By the end of the movie she is still the same problematic Barbie we were first introduced to. This is an interesting problem because it means that Ken, the movie's antagonist is actually the hero of the film. He is the only one in the film that overcomes adversity and is the only one in the film who grows and changes. We don't root for Ken, of course, but if you spend a few minutes thinking about his character arch you will realize he is actually the victim and the hero of the movie. This is what I meant by saying it is a clunky film - it has too many mixed messages, unexplored and unrealistic themes, and watered down but constant social commentary. Then add the fact that the social commentary expressed in the film is of a serious issue but is juxtaposed with a lighthearted comedic tone.Then there is the problem with the movie's portrayal of men and specifically Ken. First, lets acknowledge how woman have been poorly portrayed in past by depicting them as weak and needing men. We can agree its inappropriate - so its confusing as to why the film does the same thing, except to men. Ken is portrayed as inferior to Barbie in every way when the appropriate thing to do would be highlight the strengths in both genders. A counter argument people may make is, ""Dude, its just a movie about a doll and its a fantasy land."" I get it, its not real. But the problem is the movie depicts men as inferior and stupid in both the fantasy and real world. In fact, there is little distinction between the men in both worlds. On the other hand, the woman in the real world are depicted more genuinely and certainly more intelligently. This leads me to conclude that the writers likely do have a problem with men even if they were trying to be humorous. In fact, there is a whole subplot with an all male corporate board that seems to be a non-sequitur. It seems its only purpose in the film was to dump on men or, in the alternative, the whole subplot was intended to be something intelligent but ended up being too poorly conceived to be meaningful in any way.So, I have to say the film is disappointing and problematic in so many ways. But the potential is huge. I would look forward to a sequel but they have to drop the social commentary or, in the alternative, make a more cohesive movie with less mixed signals. Barbie should demonstrate why she is so amazing and earn her place at the top. We don't see why she is special or see her become the hero in her own movie. I expected to see a movie about a powerful woman who also likes to have fun. What I got instead was a bait and switch.",baitandswitch barbi,summari thi isnt fun lightheart fantasi market would believ it instead clunki film nearli social commentari in fact plot protagonist film patriarchi specif men the result sexist film good time frustrat mani viewer the movi may even damag woman explan belowful reviewi justifi summari i want first share film tremend amount potenti i look forward sequel come the cast excel gosl absolut steal show clearli ton fun robbi also gem quintessenti barbi they could pick better cast the set design fun probabl exactli would hope barbi film the tempo great cameo fun movi appropri selfawar humor gener land well it probabl kid movi i think i wouldnt want kid attend adult humor social commentari bit i think right audienc social commentari might elicit good discus may interest somei dont mind social commentari id prefer know film i go if i go see movi social commentari gener clunki movi barbi for exampl movi i ask sever peopl thought messag movi one person answer sure messag center around femin woman empower these theme gener everyon get behind movi isnt clear specif doe movi intend convey barbi problemat doll symbol is movi suggest patriarchi problem is woman anyth put mind is say diver import basic movi fail pinpoint exactli tri comment ongener go see movi intend social commentari come thought provok question idea it movi flip script opposit side issu becom awareinform watch movi unfortun barbi doesnt barbi live fantasi world real world n film also fantasi she doesnt face real world realist dilemma caus u evalu gender system place even time barbi subject discrimin sexism fairli constant time realist believ thu commentari come preachi anecdotalbarbi also role model hero movi it weird watch movi written empow woman also featur weak sexist femal lead the film begin barbi dismiss men bias toward woman i dont want leav spoiler semispoil movi end thing unequ sex a result film almost suggest sex shouldnt treat equal in word clear barbi barbi movi believ femal superior gendermoreov barbi strong power woman we told movi barbi inspir woman fairli constantli normal i would agre but barbi movi depict uncap weak she egocentr motiv desir beauti in fact entir plot kick find cellulit leg later revolv around selfcent interest maintain power commun it hard relat feel sympathet circumst anyth plot indict woman societi overus beauti sexual a barbi trot along path doesnt overcom anyth doesnt chang person in fact everyth accomplish someon told someon el someth not one time i recal barbi accomplish someth reevalu posit by end movi still problemat barbi first introduc thi interest problem mean ken movi antagonist actual hero film he one film overcom advers one film grow chang we dont root ken cours spend minut think charact arch realiz actual victim hero movi thi i meant say clunki film mani mix messag unexplor unrealist theme water constant social commentari then add fact social commentari express film seriou issu juxtapos lightheart comed tonethen problem movi portray men specif ken first let acknowledg woman poorli portray past depict weak need men we agre inappropri confus film thing except men ken portray inferior barbi everi way appropri thing would highlight strength gender a counter argument peopl may make dude movi doll fantasi land i get real but problem movi depict men inferior stupid fantasi real world in fact littl distinct men world on hand woman real world depict genuin certainli intellig thi lead conclud writer like problem men even tri humor in fact whole subplot male corpor board seem nonsequitur it seem purpos film dump men altern whole subplot intend someth intellig end poorli conceiv meaning wayso i say film disappoint problemat mani way but potenti huge i would look forward sequel drop social commentari altern make cohes movi le mix signal barbi demonstr amaz earn place top we dont see special see becom hero movi i expect see movi power woman also like fun what i got instead bait switch

Yes, I was fully expecting a message, but not one that would be hammered onto our heads.Zero subtlety and a deficiency of real wit.There was a moment in the film that held promise, re: Ken and the subject of masculinity, but it was squandered.This film is very fortunate for the Barbenheimer phenomenon, because I'm not sure word of mouth could have served it as well.I love me a chick flick - just not this one.",not all that clever,i regret i allow swept barbi hypeim sure reson ladiesg wait til streamsit nearli clever id hope itd ye i fulli expect messag one would hammer onto headszero subtleti defici real witther moment film held promis ken subject masculin squanderedthi film fortun barbenheim phenomenon im sure word mouth could serv welli love chick flick one
A Disappointing Experience: Barbie Movie Review,"As an avid moviegoer, I recently had the misfortune of watching the latest Barbie movie, and I must say, it was a truly disappointing experience. With high hopes for an entertaining and engaging story, I found myself utterly let down by the lackluster execution and uninspiring plot.First and foremost, the storyline was incredibly predictable and formulaic. It followed the typical ""princess in distress"" narrative, where Barbie, the protagonist, finds herself in a series of contrived situations that require her to rely on her friends to save the day. This tired and overused plotline failed to offer any surprises or originality, leaving me feeling bored and unengaged throughout the entire film.Furthermore, the characters lacked depth and development. Barbie, as the central character, was portrayed as a one-dimensional, perfect individual with no flaws or relatable qualities. This made it difficult to connect with her on any meaningful level, resulting in a lack of emotional investment in her journey. The supporting characters were equally unremarkable, serving as mere plot devices rather than fully fleshed-out individuals.The animation, while visually appealing at times, was inconsistent and failed to impress. Certain scenes appeared rushed and poorly executed, with noticeable flaws in character movements and facial expressions. This lack of attention to detail further detracted from the overall viewing experience.Additionally, the dialogue was clichéd and lacked any real substance. The script seemed to rely heavily on cheesy one-liners and forced humor, which fell flat and failed to elicit any genuine laughter or amusement. The lack of witty and intelligent dialogue further contributed to the overall mediocrity of the film.In conclusion, the Barbie movie I recently watched was a major disappointment. With a predictable plot, underdeveloped characters, and lackluster animation. While it may appeal to younger audiences, for those seeking a more sophisticated and thought-provoking film, this Barbie movie falls far short of expectations. I would not recommend it to anyone seeking quality entertainment.",a disappoint experi barbi movi review,a avid moviego i recent misfortun watch latest barbi movi i must say truli disappoint experi with high hope entertain engag stori i found utterli let lacklust execut uninspir plotfirst foremost storylin incred predict formula it follow typic princess distress narr barbi protagonist find seri contriv situat requir reli friend save day thi tire overus plotlin fail offer surpris origin leav feel bore unengag throughout entir filmfurthermor charact lack depth develop barbi central charact portray onedimension perfect individu flaw relat qualiti thi made difficult connect meaning level result lack emot invest journey the support charact equal unremark serv mere plot devic rather fulli fleshedout individualsth anim visual appeal time inconsist fail impress certain scene appear rush poorli execut notic flaw charact movement facial express thi lack attent detail detract overal view experienceaddit dialogu clichd lack real substanc the script seem reli heavili cheesi onelin forc humor fell flat fail elicit genuin laughter amus the lack witti intellig dialogu contribut overal mediocr filmin conclus barbi movi i recent watch major disappoint with predict plot underdevelop charact lacklust anim while may appeal younger audienc seek sophist thoughtprovok film barbi movi fall far short expect i would recommend anyon seek qualiti entertain

Congrats to the director who's also the writer with her husband I believe. To the great production design. To the actors especially Margot Robbie and Ryan gosling who continues to amuse and surprise with his ability to switch characters and add humor and a little bit of fun to his roles. And he gets to sing again.

Barbie Girl In The Real World,"I didn't expect to like Barbie as much as I did, but I enjoyed most aspects of it.There's an edge to the humor, the performances are convincing (Robbie and Gosling go all in, and it makes the film so much better), and there's plenty on screen that is both funny and relates to the real world.Beat for beat, the story isn't particularly surprising. You can see where it's headed a mile away. But the way it carves its own path there using its unique premise, the property, and its stylistic blend of modern humor that reflects the real world is particularly well done. Everything comes together well.Though I don't love it as much as most people due to aforementioned predictability and some of the jokes not landing as well as others, it's still a fun time. Oh, and ""I'm Just Ken"" is an absolute banger.",barbi girl in the real world,i didnt expect like barbi much i i enjoy aspect itther edg humor perform convinc robbi gosl go make film much better there plenti screen funni relat real worldbeat beat stori isnt particularli surpris you see head mile away but way carv path use uniqu premis properti stylist blend modern humor reflect real world particularli well done everyth come togeth wellthough i dont love much peopl due aforement predict joke land well other still fun time oh im just ken absolut banger
Whacky and Wonderful but a little bit preachy,"I loved so much about this movie. From the costumes to the sets to the colors to the soundtrack to the excellent comedy. I also really loved the plot and takeaway of the film.With that said, as someone who believes deeply in the message, it was a little bit too preachy. It laid the message on very thick. And I get it; it's an important and very real topic that has a massive amount of cultural relevance. But we have to give the audience some credit that we can get the idea without the repetition.That doesn't detract from what a fun yet emotional movie this is.

Barbie: an enjoyable mess.,"Barbie is enjoyable, thats for sure, but it brings some problems such as the films plot, which is all over the place, and goes in a lot of unlikable directions at times. However, this doesn't bring the film down, as there are enjoyable and smart aspects of the film that climb the hurdles to make Barbie an enjoyable summer watch that caters for all ages!The film kicks things off in Barbie land, and its here where audiences will start to fall in love with the aesthetics of the film. Astonishing set designs,usage of visual fx and cinematography really help us step into the shoes of a Barbie doll. The first act of the film really focus on this idea, and almost shows off the impressive work that has been put into the creation of this sublime world.It is when we delve further into this plot though that we start to see issues. The whole vibe the film gives off and its tone surprisingly shifts into something much darker and political when the real world gets involved. It is definitely far from unwatchable though, and the charm of the characters and the humor actually make this specific part of the storyline enjoyable. Despite being fun, the story goes off track a lot, completely ignoring any form of logic to take risks by giving off a little too many messages that only makes the plot more predictable and cliché.The individual, interior journeys these characters go on though is the clear standout of the film for me. The arcs of almost all characters are played out really cleverly, and whilst the story as a whole is a mess, the developing dynamics between the Barbie's and the Ken's make this film worth watching alone. What is done with these characters is really fitting to some of the messages the film tries to give off, even though it may seem there are too many to process.Acting is phenomenal. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are CLEAR standouts, yet all cast members have their moments.Ultimately, Barbie does get messy, especially when the real-world comes to play. Yet its the exploration of Barbie Land and what it means to be a barbie that make this a fun, yet somewhat perceptive, summer watch!",barbi enjoy mess,barbi enjoy that sure bring problem film plot place goe lot unlik direct time howev doesnt bring film enjoy smart aspect film climb hurdl make barbi enjoy summer watch cater agesth film kick thing barbi land audienc start fall love aesthet film astonish set designsusag visual fx cinematographi realli help u step shoe barbi doll the first act film realli focu idea almost show impress work put creation sublim worldit delv plot though start see issu the whole vibe film give tone surprisingli shift someth much darker polit real world get involv it definit far unwatch though charm charact humor actual make specif part storylin enjoy despit fun stori goe track lot complet ignor form logic take risk give littl mani messag make plot predict clichth individu interior journey charact go though clear standout film the arc almost charact play realli cleverli whilst stori whole mess develop dynam barbi ken make film worth watch alon what done charact realli fit messag film tri give even though may seem mani processact phenomen both margot robbi ryan gosl clear standout yet cast member momentsultim barbi get messi especi realworld come play yet explor barbi land mean barbi make fun yet somewhat percept summer watch
different people will perceive it differently,"For one. I really liked it and all the people I know that went to liked it and most of them did get emotional throughout( tears) .

Other than it's humar and when to use it , the movie knows when to crack a joke and when to move the plot further, I did really like the premise I'm glad how they went for the story and once again i would recommend it to anyone, most complaints that I have heard in person are from people that didn't give it a good try.",differ peopl perceiv differ,for one i realli like peopl i know went like get emot throughout tear but i show emot promin movi help peopl time peopl ie men even man i would still recommend movi i real big complaint also noth right home wont give anyth away other humar use movi know crack joke move plot i realli like premis im glad went stori would recommend anyon complaint i heard person peopl didnt give good tri
Surprisingly entertaining romp with Barbie and Ken,"Ruth Handler, the inventor of Barbie,had a vision of a grown-up doll that little girls could love. In Barbie's world, everything is perfect, not messy and unpredictable like in the real world. You can dress her and play with her in whatever fantasy you want . In a long scene, Mattel executives are chasing the now human Barbie to get her ""back in the box"" acknowledging its patriarchal structure. Is designed to keep women second class. It does mention but glosses over its role in pushing Handler out of the company, supposedly for tax
violations. One critic noted that Mattel mentions itself no less than 35 times during the film. That said, there are some hysterically funny bits that will appeal particualrly to those of us over 60 years old.I thought Ryan Gosling was miscast as Ken. But Margot Robbie as Barbie was spot on.",surprisingli entertain romp barbi ken,ruth handler inventor barbiehad vision grownup doll littl girl could love in barbi world everyth perfect messi unpredict like real world you dress play whatev fantasi want in long scene mattel execut chase human barbi get back box acknowledg patriarch structur is design keep woman second class it mention gloss role push handler compani supposedli tax violat one critic note mattel mention le time film that said hyster funni bit appeal particualrli u year oldi thought ryan gosl miscast ken but margot robbi barbi spot
Disappointment,"The Barbie movie left me with a deep sense of disappointment in my cinematic journey. From my perspective, the film failed to captivate and provide an entertaining experience, and its storyline appeared to lack depth and substance. Regrettably, it seemed to target a younger demographic, leaving little to engage more mature viewers.In agreement with my sentiments, my mother shared a similar disinterest in the movie, finding it more irksome than enjoyable. The overwhelming acclaim and popularity of Barbie remain a puzzling enigma to me, as I perceive the film as overrated and lacking the qualities that should warrant such fervent admiration.",disappoint,the barbi movi left deep sen disappoint cinemat journey from perspect film fail captiv provid entertain experi storylin appear lack depth substanc regrett seem target younger demograph leav littl engag matur viewersin agreement sentiment mother share similar disinterest movi find irksom enjoy the overwhelm acclaim popular barbi remain puzzl enigma i perceiv film overr lack qualiti warrant fervent admir
Not as expected,"I went into this movie thinking it would be super preachy and all about feminism, but I found that many people have had different views or takeaways from the movie. I interpreted the overall point of the movie to be that today's feminism has gone a little overboard and has put way too much pressure on women to feel like we have to be the career driven, leader boss b*itch to have a meaningful life. This movie voices that sometimes women (while respecting the women that do) don't want to be a leader, who's a mom and has the career. Sometimes we just want to be average and that's ok. I also felt the mother and daughter scenes in the movie tug at my heart and GG did a great job and adding those pieces throughout the movie. While I agree that it was annoying how the Kens were treated at the beginning of the movie, I felt the ending tied it all together. Overall, I enjoyed the movie. As humans I think we sometimes find ourselves wondering what was I made for? And even though this was referring to Barbie, it can be very relatable.",not expect,i went movi think would super preachi femin i found mani peopl differ view takeaway movi i interpret overal point movi today femin gone littl overboard put way much pressur woman feel like career driven leader bos bitch meaning life thi movi voic sometim woman respect woman dont want leader who mom career sometim want averag that ok i also felt mother daughter scene movi tug heart gg great job ad piec throughout movi while i agre annoy ken treat begin movi i felt end tie togeth overal i enjoy movi a human i think sometim find wonder i made and even though refer barbi relat
A sales pitch,"A very confusing plot, under-developed characters and a haughty attitude to glorify the plastic doll in all possible ways, mixing patriarchy, feminism, women's rights, gender equality, sex etc etc. Mattel did everything they could to ruin a good concept, but I am sorry it's just a plastic doll.There are some interesting points, like the emotions of Barbie and Ken when they visit the real world for the first time, but they quickly move away from it and is not fully developed. The way they move in the Barbie world, is it children moving them in the real world, and speaking for them? Not-developed. The weird doll, what happened to her, how does she feel? Not-developed.

A Missed Opportunity,"Barbie, the iconic doll that has been a beloved part of countless childhoods for generations, has finally made her way to the big screen in the 2023 movie adaptation aptly titled ""Barbie.""On the flip side, the film's attempts at humor often fell flat. The jokes and gags felt forced, and some of the comedic moments were cringe-worthy. It seemed as though the filmmakers were trying too hard to make Barbie relevant to a modern audience, resulting in a lack of authenticity in the humor.Barbie left me somewhat disappointed. While it showcased catchy songs, the storyline felt clichéd, lacking depth. Margot Robbie's work for Barbie was commendable, but the overall plot failed to engage adults. It's a decent choice for kids, but falls short of the mark for a broader audience. 5/10.",a miss opportun,barbi icon doll belov part countless childhood gener final made way big screen movi adapt aptli titl barbieon flip side film attempt humor often fell flat the joke gag felt forc comed moment cringeworthi it seem though filmmak tri hard make barbi relev modern audienc result lack authent humorbarbi left somewhat disappoint while showcas catchi song storylin felt clichd lack depth margot robbi work barbi commend overal plot fail engag adult it decent choic kid fall short mark broader audienc
"Refreshing and Creative, More Than Just a Gimmick","Barbie is a delightful and creatively refreshing comedy that breathes new life into the iconic doll's world. From the moment the film began, I was captivated by its smart and subversive storytelling, which cleverly blends meta-humour with a dash of eccentricity.The production design is a standout feature, a visually dazzling and wonderfully pink-themed universe. Margot Robbie's portrayal of Barbie is nothing short of impressive, skilfully capturing both the character's earnestness and humour. Her performance, combined with Greta Gerwig's skilful directing, makes for a truly entertaining and memorable experience.Throughout the film, I found myself chuckling at the witty humour and enjoying the unexpectedly bold take on what Barbie represents. The movie strikes a fine balance between honouring the iconic brand and playfully challenging its conventions, resulting in a unique and rewarding cinematic experience.While the film's intentions are commendable, there were moments when it felt like the themes could have been explored more deeply, leaving me slightly wanting more. Nonetheless, Barbie remains a fun and enjoyable ride, filled with charm and charismatic performances that made it stand out as one of the year's best comedies so far.In the end, Barbie proves to be much more than just a marketing gimmick, showcasing a refreshing take on a beloved cultural icon and making it a must-see for anyone seeking a smart, humorous, and visually arresting cinematic adventure.",refresh creativ more than just gimmick,barbi delight creativ refresh comedi breath new life icon doll world from moment film began i captiv smart subvers storytel cleverli blend metahumour dash eccentricityth product design standout featur visual dazzl wonder pinkthem univers margot robbi portray barbi noth short impress skil captur charact earnest humour her perform combin greta gerwig skil direct make truli entertain memor experiencethroughout film i found chuckl witti humour enjoy unexpectedli bold take barbi repres the movi strike fine balanc honour icon brand play challeng convent result uniqu reward cinemat experiencewhil film intent commend moment felt like theme could explor deepli leav slightli want nonetheless barbi remain fun enjoy ride fill charm charismat perform made stand one year best comedi farin end barbi prove much market gimmick showcas refresh take belov cultur icon make mustse anyon seek smart humor visual arrest cinemat adventur
"Super fun, super colorful, and very plastic!","The entire cast does such a great job and it seems everyone had a fun time making the film. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are of course stand outs, but Michael Cera as Allan and Issa Rae as Barbie were also phenomenol! The sets were gorgeous, according to behind the scenes, everything was practical when it could be, and that made such an obvious difference in bringing the Barbie world to life. The costumes!!! So much fun, so much pink, and Robbie's long-standing relation with chanel wormed it's way into costuming as well, truly there are a bunch of unique and extremely well done pieces!However, this is still a movie made to appeal to the widest audience to make the most money possible. There's some popular feminism, but nothing that challenges status quo, and nothing too disagreeable for the average audience. It's pretty to look at, but lacks adequate substance in favor of just bringing up the talking point to say they acknowledged it. Furthermore the movie is extremely uninterested in exploring anything about Mattel's business practices or perpetual consumerism. Not that I was expecting it to, but both those potential issues are very blatantly sidelined and made for humor which sometimes feels like a bit much for me.Anyways, if you want a pretty looking and pretty funny movie that'll definitely continue to make a stupid amount of money, it is well worth it!",super fun super color plastic,the entir cast great job seem everyon fun time make film margot robbi ryan gosl cours stand out michael cera allan issa rae barbi also phenomenol the set gorgeou accord behind scene everyth practic could made obviou differ bring barbi world life the costum so much fun much pink robbi longstand relat chanel worm way costum well truli bunch uniqu extrem well done pieceshowev still movi made appeal widest audienc make money possibl there popular femin noth challeng statu quo noth disagre averag audienc it pretti look lack adequ substanc favor bring talk point say acknowledg furthermor movi extrem uninterest explor anyth mattel busi practic perpetu consumer not i expect potenti issu blatantli sidelin made humor sometim feel like bit much meanyway want pretti look pretti funni movi thatll definit continu make stupid amount money well worth

Barbie and her plight of finding the meaning of life,"Barbie is a story of a Barbie gaining sentience when her owner hits a bad time affecting her life in BarbieLand. She develops human feelings and tries to come to term with it by meeting her humans whilst forced to string along her Ken. Ken sees the real world, he finds more things that can be of his benefit, MEANWHILE Barbie falls into much deeper bad time. Ruckus happens as the Mattel Company AND Barbie tries to make thing back to what it is used to be AND BECOMES A DASH before things go to late.A very well conceptualized film about Barbie and her plight of finding the meaning of life. I think this is a great idea BUT clearly there are things that can be better.Loved mostly its darker and dramatic moments. Gerwig wrestling the ideas of Barbie both in the Feminist context and the how the public sees it at large was a masterclass. It is where the story really held its landing. YOU could see how Barbie both as an idea and a product, comes to term of how she affected the culture or just how the culture at large move ahead from it. The scene with Ruth and Barbie is so well placed in the script.But for the mixed parts of the film, I felt more mixed with the comedic aspect of the film. The script was fun but verbally the schtick can be quite repetitive. It also was not that witty AND pass quirkiness as such. It was not. Visually, its funnier though but a lot of the jokes can be a hit or miss. I do not think Gerwig understood HOW TO END it with the Ken's BUT practically its her nodding the first wave Feminist, by them maybe trying to get the fundamental rights first before going all out but without any repercussion for the Ken Movement.I also did not like how anti-climactic the Un-Kendollification of the Barbie's was. The grand standing gesture was just repeated too much, that it kinda loses a lot of its power but I guess it was to make sense of the plans for the Ken's afterward.Acting wise definitely, I think Gosling did the best with the comedic material, with Robbie excelling in more dramatic portion of the film. Not as impressed with the others except maybe for McKinnon's weird Barbie and Issa Rae as President Barbie, which both has moments but too small to really be noteworthy.I think it is definitely overhyped AND was meant for children BUT Gerwig did great with all the hoopla she had faced to make this film, especially with its themes of Female Identity AND Barbie herself, the portion of the film I think it had its best success. Robbie deserves the accolades as she brings to life Barbie. Gosling was also good as the very much confused Ken. 3.5/5.",barbi plight find mean life,barbi stori barbi gain sentienc owner hit bad time affect life barbieland she develop human feel tri come term meet human whilst forc string along ken ken see real world find thing benefit meanwhil barbi fall much deeper bad time rucku happen mattel compani and barbi tri make thing back use and becom a dash thing go latea well conceptu film barbi plight find mean life i think great idea but clearli thing betterlov mostli darker dramat moment gerwig wrestl idea barbi feminist context public see larg masterclass it stori realli held land you could see barbi idea product come term affect cultur cultur larg move ahead the scene ruth barbi well place scriptbut mix part film i felt mix comed aspect film the script fun verbal schtick quit repetit it also witti and pas quirki it visual funnier though lot joke hit miss i think gerwig understood how to end ken but practic nod first wave feminist mayb tri get fundament right first go without repercuss ken movementi also like anticlimact unkendollif barbi the grand stand gestur repeat much kinda lose lot power i guess make sen plan ken afterwardact wise definit i think gosl best comed materi robbi excel dramat portion film not impress other except mayb mckinnon weird barbi issa rae presid barbi moment small realli noteworthyi think definit overhyp and meant child but gerwig great hoopla face make film especi theme femal ident and barbi portion film i think best success robbi deserv accolad bring life barbi gosl also good much confus ken

"""Everything is almost like... reversed here.""","Every fiber of my being insisted I not watch this movie. However, I just know that it's one of the films that will show up on IMDb's 2024 Oscar Highlights, so if I want to earn that badge, I can't just rate it without watching and reviewing it. Quite honestly, if it wasn't for the pink overload, a good part of the flick was quite entertaining. I thought it a brilliant parody and a shot against crass commercialism, even while engaging in it with all the opening hype in tandem with ""Oppenheimer"" this past summer. Sasha's mom (America Ferrera) had the greatest monolog in the story when she went on about the dichotomy women find themselves in, a no-win situation the way her entire argument was framed. As Stereotypical Barbie, I don't think anyone could argue against the casting of Margot Robbie. I don't know if Ryan Gosling was the best pick to portray Ken, but he did a good job, but I resist thinking that 'Kendom' was some sort of take-off on the word 'condom'. Of course, I could be reading too much into that aspect of the story. So there you have it, short and sweet, and a hat tip to Rhea Perlman for portraying the original creator of Barbie, Ruth Handler, who named the doll after her own daughter.",everyth almost like revers,everi fiber insist i watch movi howev i know one film show imdb oscar highlight i want earn badg i cant rate without watch review quit honestli wasnt pink overload good part flick quit entertain i thought brilliant parodi shot crass commerci even engag open hype tandem oppenheim past summer sasha mom america ferrera greatest monolog stori went dichotomi woman find nowin situat way entir argument frame a stereotyp barbi i dont think anyon could argu cast margot robbi i dont know ryan gosl best pick portray ken good job i resist think kendom sort takeoff word condom of cours i could read much aspect stori so short sweet hat tip rhea perlman portray origin creator barbi ruth handler name doll daughter
The Long and Boring Commercial of a Doll's Manufacturer,"I was reluctant to see ""Barbie"", but yesterday my wife wanted to watch it, maybe because if the hype. What a waste of time! ""Barbie"" (2023) is a long and boring ad of a doll's manufacturer, maybe expecting to increase its sales. It is impressive how, in the present days, people (or maneuvering mass) are manipulated by ""influencers"", bots or questionable ""professional"" critics. The only attraction in this bizarre movie is the beauty of Margot Robbie; even the excellent Ryan Gosling probably has received a large amount of money to be of service of such a ridiculous character. Fortunately, there are other viewers that agree with my view of this forgettable dull film. There is still hope on the real world.

"Barbie world meets the real world, and there are sparks.","There has been such advanced publicity for this movie over the months it was kinda surreal to sit down and actually watch it with my wife. At home on DVD from our public library. No extras on the disc so no insights into how it was made.When it was over we both smiled, we enjoyed it. Yes, there is a ""message"" that apparently upsets a lot of viewers, regarding females having a harder time getting respect and career opportunities. Like the board of the company being a very large group of men who didn't really acknowledge possible roles for women.Whether you like that message or not, and if you evaluate it on how good the story, acting, and cinematography are, then it is a very good movie.Margot Robbie is Barbie and Ryan Gosling is Ken. In the fantasy Barbie world the movie begins in there are lots of Barbies and lots of Kens, just like over the years there have been various versions of the doll sold. These are not real people, they are life-sized dolls, Barbie even remarks at one point, she doesn't have a vagina and Ken doesn't have a penis.Then Barbie meets Ruth Handler (Rhea Perlman), the woman who created the Barbie doll in 1959. Through that conversation Barbie works her way through a series of fantasy scenes to make it to the real world of Los Angeles.So the movie is partly in the fantasy Barbie world, partly in the real world, and through it all Barbie gets new appreciations for her life. As it ends she is in the real world, she arrives at a doctor's office, ""I'm here to see my gynecologist.""",barbi world meet real world spark,there advanc public movi month kinda surreal sit actual watch wife at home dvd public librari no extra disc insight madewhen smile enjoy ye messag appar upset lot viewer regard femal harder time get respect career opportun like board compani larg group men didnt realli acknowledg possibl role womenwheth like messag evalu good stori act cinematographi good moviemargot robbi barbi ryan gosl ken in fantasi barbi world movi begin lot barbi lot ken like year variou version doll sold these real peopl life doll barbi even remark one point doesnt vagina ken doesnt penisthen barbi meet ruth handler rhea perlman woman creat barbi doll through convers barbi work way seri fantasi scene make real world lo angelesso movi partli fantasi barbi world partli real world barbi get new appreci life a end real world arriv doctor offic im see gynecologist
Shattered Utopia,"Barbie was another movie that fell victim to its own hype. I was told several times that this movie was a must see so I had grand expectations going in. I was expecting a masterpiece. It was a piece, I'll give it that.Barbie is a shattered utopia movie. You know the movie: the one in which everything begins perfectly and in harmony until something, however insignificant, breaks that harmony. Just think and I'm sure you can recall a movie. It doesn't have to even be a societal utopia, it could just be the utopia of the main character him/herself like Ryan Reynolds in ""Free Guy.""The shattered utopia in Barbie was Barbieland. There all the different Barbies of different ethnicities, different careers, and different sizes lived together in perfect harmony. Living among them were Kens who were also of different ethnicities but seemingly no careers or tasks whatsoever except to perhaps be accessories. Everyone was beautiful, happy, and worry free until Stereotypical Barbie (their words not mine), played by Margot Robbie, began having thoughts of death. These thoughts created small bits of imperfection which threatened all of Barbieland. To fix this issue, Barbie had to find her owner/player and fix what ailed her.She and Stereotypical Ken (Ryan Gosling) exited Barbieland into Los Angeles of the real world. There she met Gloria (America Ferrera) and Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt), Gloria's daughter, but that created more problems than it solved.What the smashed utopia ultimately brought about was knowledge of the existence of a patriarchy. A very hyperbolic patriarchy. That patriarchy would make its way back to Barbieland where Barbie, Gloria, and Sasha would have to try to restore the old order.""Barbie"" definitely gets points for casting and the glamor and glitz. The line up was big time, featuring Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Dua Lipa, Kingsley Ben-Adir, John Cena, Michael Cera, Rhea Perlman, and Will Ferrell. I still think that had I gone into this movie with no expectations, I would've like it more.Viewable on Max.",shatter utopia,barbi anoth movi fell victim hype i told sever time movi must see i grand expect go i expect masterpiec it piec ill give thatbarbi shatter utopia movi you know movi one everyth begin perfectli harmoni someth howev insignific break harmoni just think im sure recal movi it doesnt even societ utopia could utopia main charact himherself like ryan reynold free guyth shatter utopia barbi barbieland there differ barbi differ ethnic differ career differ size live togeth perfect harmoni live among ken also differ ethnic seemingli career task whatsoev except perhap accessori everyon beauti happi worri free stereotyp barbi word mine play margot robbi began thought death these thought creat small bit imperfect threaten barbieland to fix issu barbi find ownerplay fix ail hersh stereotyp ken ryan gosl exit barbieland lo angel real world there met gloria america ferrera sasha ariana greenblatt gloria daughter creat problem solvedwhat smash utopia ultim brought knowledg exist patriarchi a hyperbol patriarchi that patriarchi would make way back barbieland barbi gloria sasha would tri restor old orderbarbi definit get point cast glamor glitz the line big time featur issa rae kate mckinnon dua lipa kingsley benadir john cena michael cera rhea perlman will ferrel i still think i gone movi expect i wouldv like moreview max
Not a great movie,"The real world depicted in the movie is strangely devoid of normal people - everything looks fake and staged when Barbie goes to the real world. There are not enough extras in the real world scenes to make it look normal. I understand the filmmakers were attempting to make a statement about women's rights, etc., but it is done is such a heavy handed manner that it comes off as very forced. The costume & production design plus the glitzy choreographed numbers are not enough to make up for the missing substance of Barbie's need to figure out why her life feels wrong.

Fantastic movie!!!,"Barbie was a great film. This movie is so well written and super clever. Makes you laugh, cry, and ponder what it means to live in today's world.This film has a message for us all and makes some excellent philosophical points that will leave you thinking when the credits roll. It's that kind of movie. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that this movie didn't go the cartoony, campy direction. It so easily could have. But it went a much more thoughtful and clever way than I ever would've anticipated. I predict this movie becoming a classic, totally quotable movie, for years to come. Most of all I enjoyed myself at the movies again.",fantast movi,barbi great film thi movi well written super clever make laugh cri ponder mean live today worldthi film messag u make excel philosoph point leav think credit roll it kind movi i pleasantli surpris see movi didnt go cartooni campi direct it easili could but went much thought clever way i ever wouldv anticip i predict movi becom classic total quotabl movi year come most i enjoy movi
A great balance between social commentary and pure fun,"The movie starts with the presentation of iconic barbie world and hilarious childhood references but it gets progressively deeper.It tackles sexism, misogyny and existentialism. While it left me crying laughing it appeared a bit all over the place. I believe it would be a lot beter if it had only focused on one theme.Other than that it was an insanely self-aware, bizarre, iconic, relatable and suprisingly deep movie. Greta knew what she was doing. Goslings line delivery was hilarious and Robbie added range to an expectedly superficial character.I would also like to mention the heatbreaking yet beautiful Billie Eilish masterpiece of a song.

Better the Second Time!,"I'm a dude so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt.When I saw it for the first time, I really enjoyed it, but it was a lot to take in. I've heard talks about this movie for YEARS, and it was different than I expected. I could recognize the performances were amazing and Greg blew it out of the park with the directing and writing and I had so much fun. But all I saw was a ""fun"" movie about ""being a women?""...HOWEVER, after I left, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Now that I knew the plot I felt I had to watch again to really understand what the movie was saying. So I watched it AGAIN, and I never go to the movies twice! I was BLOWN AWAY. Not only did I see so many details about the Barbie world but got a grasp of what Greta was saying about society l. About women. Men. Corporations. Mothers. Daughters. War.Do your self a favor.

Barbie Review,"To see a universe that's a Barbie world where the Barbies are the rulers and the Kens are just there to support Barbie brings our universe into focus. Ken doesn't feel loved and respected or important in the Barbie world. He steps into the real world where men are respected and many thing revolves around them and he realizes that he can be more. I hope that this movie could help men feel more empathy towards women and the way this world makes them feel less valuable and important. Women couldn't own property before and in Barbie world Kens didn't have a home to call their own or any important positions.Because women in the real world wear multiple hats, they have to be seen in many ways. They have to do many contradictory things to be liked. Women have to tie themselves in knots to be liked by other people. That's what this show tried to say too.I wish the Barbies realized how they were excluding the Kens and not treating them with respect and made changes to fix that. The world we live in is so male focused that we are so used to it that it seems normal and not unusual. But just like everything being ruled and centered on the women in the Barbie world seems strange, you realize the reverse is strange too.The movie had that message to me but it also was fun and light hearted and went by very quickly. It was enjoyable and entertaining.I guess the very end was not satisfying to me though. It got too weird and pointless at the end.",barbi review,to see univers that barbi world barbi ruler ken support barbi bring univers focu ken doesnt feel love respect import barbi world he step real world men respect mani thing revolv around realiz i hope movi could help men feel empathi toward woman way world make feel le valuabl import woman couldnt properti barbi world ken didnt home call import positionsbecaus woman real world wear multipl hat seen mani way they mani contradictori thing like woman tie knot like peopl that show tri say tooi wish barbi realiz exclud ken treat respect made chang fix the world live male focus use seem normal unusu but like everyth rule center woman barbi world seem strang realiz revers strang tooth movi messag also fun light heart went quickli it enjoy entertainingi guess end satisfi though it got weird pointless end
I already need to see it again!,"It was nostalgic, hilarious, esthetically orgasmic and very moving. It covered all generations of Barbie, which was my hands down favorite toy as a kid. It also touched on the female experience in a really welcoming, wonderful way. I felt it included aspects of the male experience that are important as well. Awesome soundtrack, AMAZING SETS, and wardrobes. The cast was amazing, the writing was perfect, such an original, unique stroy line. If you're going to criticize this movie for going ""against your political beliefs"" then you don't deserve this movie anyways. Women are allowed to talk about the female experience and Barbie was a great way to do it!

Come on Barbie let's go party!,"""Come on Barbie let's go party!""A comedy fun for audiences. Laugh, laugh, cry and laugh again. The first film I've watched that Greta Gerwig directed and I was impressed on how she was able to pull off a good film.Probably not the typical toy to live action movie set up but it really has the feels of Toy Story (crossover maybe? Kidding). What the film offers is a lot of comedy which movie viewers will likely to enjoy. It pays homage to the different types of Barbie dolls but that depressed and ordinary Barbie were the best in this film. With Barbie, there comes Ken and Alan? But Ken was not sidelined in this film. In fact, I kinda felt more empathy on Ken's side than on Barbie's. Yeah this is a film based on Barbie who of course we know that without Barbie, there won't be a Ken. However, this film shows its viewers that it shouldn't be that way. Ken is as important as Barbie. On the other hand, that speech of ""Gloria"" was really moving and very inspiring.This film takes us to a world where toys and humans interact. Where those who live in a cycle can break the chain and have a decision to make. Where every individual has a choice and every person in this world is as important as the other.Barbie is 7/10. Enjoyable, fun for family however as my friend have said, there were scenes in this film that felt like ""what's next?"" or some parts felt like fillers. Still, it was enjoyable and a good film.On the side note, Greta Gerwig, PLEASE DO WELL ON NARNIA ADAPTATIONS.

I went in with low expectations...,"What would make a grown man watch 'Barbie'? I've been asking myself this since I heard about the release of this live-action Barbie film. Isn't this just for girls who idolize Barbie dolls, or women who have fond memories of playing with Barbie dolls? You have to immerse yourself in a girl's world to fully understand the film.I guess it was the hype that prompted me to watch 'Barbie'. In the opening narration, the film explains why the Barbie dolls became such a phenomenon and I found this interesting. I never thought about it (maybe because I didn't play with dolls!!), but the Barbie dolls were apparently the first adult dolls on the market. All other dolls prior to Barbie were baby dolls. Interesting.Margot Robbie stars as Stereotypical Barbie. Yes, it does get confusing, because ALL the females are called Barbie and ALL the men are called Ken. Ryan Gosling stars as (stereotypical) Ken, and might I say he is looking mighty fine! Ryan is in excellent shape and would indeed make me want to play with him...erm, the doll, I mean...oh, whatever...Back to the movie. So, the Barbies and the Kens live in harmony in the perfect world of Barbieland. Life is a party and they're all blissful. Until Barbie starts having thoughts of death - a thought that never crossed their minds before. Barbie then starts to malfunction, and is ordered by Weird Barbie to go to the real world to find out who is playing with her. Ken decides to join her on her journey and so these 'dolls' enter the real world.Something you have to keep in mind when watching 'Barbie' is that it is made in the way girls would play with their dolls. It does not follow a similar narration to most movies out there. I think many viewers might not understand this concept. I honestly went in with low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining I found the film. Ok, then having said that, I enjoyed the first two acts far more than the third act.For me, it felt like the film fell apart during the third act. It became a mess in a way, slapstick, and also far too feminist. Fair enough, this is about girl dolls, but for me as a man it became offensive in a way. I also believe this could send out a very wrong message to girls. If it wasn't for the chaotic final act, I would have enjoyed the film much better as a whole.One has to admire the film's incredible production design. I predict 'Barbie' will receive an Oscar nomination for Best Production Design. The sets are beautiful and colourful, as if toys came to life. I also thought Margot Robbie was well cast as Barbie. Ryan Gosling is far too good an actor for the rather silly role of Ken, and I believe any actor would have sufficed as Ken.",i went low expect,what would make grown man watch barbi ive ask sinc i heard releas liveact barbi film isnt girl idol barbi doll woman fond memori play barbi doll you immers girl world fulli understand filmi guess hype prompt watch barbi in open narrat film explain barbi doll becam phenomenon i found interest i never thought mayb i didnt play doll barbi doll appar first adult doll market all doll prior barbi babi doll interestingmargot robbi star stereotyp barbi ye get confus all femal call barbi all men call ken ryan gosl star stereotyp ken might i say look mighti fine ryan excel shape would inde make want play himerm doll i meanoh whateverback movi so barbi ken live harmoni perfect world barbieland life parti theyr bliss until barbi start thought death thought never cross mind barbi start malfunct order weird barbi go real world find play ken decid join journey doll enter real worldsometh keep mind watch barbi made way girl would play doll it follow similar narrat movi i think mani viewer might understand concept i honestli went low expect pleasantli surpris entertain i found film ok said i enjoy first two act far third actfor felt like film fell apart third act it becam mess way slapstick also far feminist fair enough girl doll man becam offens way i also believ could send wrong messag girl if wasnt chaotic final act i would enjoy film much better wholeon admir film incred product design i predict barbi receiv oscar nomin best product design the set beauti colour toy came life i also thought margot robbi well cast barbi ryan gosl far good actor rather silli role ken i believ actor would suffic ken

A Good Movie That Should Have Been A Great Movie,"This was a very fun, very engaging premise. I don't know if I'd call it groundbreaking, since it's a little derivative of Toy Story and Extra Guy, but this definitely works. The scenery and cast are great, and the movie bristles with energy.I just wish they kept this a little more light-hearted and a little less preachy. There are countless movies that lament victimhood and discrimination, and countless movies that showcase estranged parents and children magically reuniting through remarkable events. But how many great comedies are there these days? How about, for once, just keeping things light and entertaining? (The patriarchy? Seriously?)Regardless, I think most of the audience loved it, and I think most of the women wanted to stand up and cheer during the Mom's big speech. It's a visual feast with just enough laughs and a lot of star power, and you will probably be glad you went.",a good movi that should have been a great movi,thi fun engag premis i dont know id call groundbreak sinc littl deriv toy stori extra guy definit work the sceneri cast great movi bristl energyi wish kept littl lightheart littl le preachi there countless movi lament victimhood discrimin countless movi showcas estrang parent child magic reunit remark event but mani great comedi day how keep thing light entertain the patriarchi seriouslyregardless i think audienc love i think woman want stand cheer mom big speech it visual feast enough laugh lot star power probabl glad went
Avoid like the plague,"A confused, misfiring, tedious and pretentious affair. I was expecting much better, yet ultimately disappointed. Margot Robbie (and to a lesser extent, Ryan Gosling) is very good, but otherwise even she can't save this twaddle. Don't listen to the critics - it is crap!Pros: the opening scene apeing '2001 a Space Odyssey' was funny.Cons:
It needed better editing to create a more coherent structure
It had very dull patches (despite the pink)
The emphasis on the 'patriarchy' was definitely laid on too thick
Will Ferrell was not funny in this. He needs to really understand that whatever comes out of his mouth is not necessarily instant comedy gold.Avoid!!!!!",avoid like plagu,a confus misfir tediou pretenti affair i expect much better yet ultim disappoint margot robbi lesser extent ryan gosl good otherwis even cant save twaddl dont listen critic crappro open scene ape space odyssey funnycon it need better edit creat coher structur it dull patch despit pink the emphasi patriarchi definit laid thick will ferrel funni he need realli understand whatev come mouth necessarili instant comedi goldavoid
Must-Watch for Women Empowerment,"When I watched the trailer for the first time, I wasn't sure if I would want to watch the movie, but all the great marketing and internet hype made me excited so I watched it, and I couldn't be happier! I have to say that at least every girl should watch this movie!!!The representation of girls ""in a man's world"" and the difference between a fantasy and the reality are shown greatly, but apart from that, the movie and the script just carry such a powerful message towards women that should be heard. When I went out of the cinema, I felt so empowered and self-confident!Kudos to Greta Gerwig and her entire team for creating such a vital movie for women.Another important fact is that the actors and actresses absolutely nailed it!!! Margot Robbie played her role so well, I was actually convinced she was Barbie, and Ryan Gosling had the absolute best facial expressions. I enjoyed watching them sooo much. Worthy to mention is also the awesome work of the other actors and actresses: THEY WERE ALL AMAZING!!! Whoever did the casting for this movie should get a raise. Everybody managed to portray their characters so well!!!One of my favorite scenes was the fight between the Kens because of how realistic the actors played it!And the costumes and decorations/houses should also be acknowledged. I watched the Dreamhouse Tour on YouTube and I appreciated all the detail so much! Barbie's cowboy costume was the banger, I think that was my favourite fit from the entire movie.And the music!!! ""I'm just Ken"" is still stuck in my head, and whenever it comes on shuffle, I scream to it dramatically. :) But it's not only this song, I keep listening to the Barbie Album on Spotify because all the songs are so catchy!!!I really want to rewatch this movie!!! It's a solid 10/10 from me. :) (I'm a girl, btw, if you couldn't tell xD.)",mustwatch woman empower,when i watch trailer first time i wasnt sure i would want watch movi great market internet hype made excit i watch i couldnt happier i say least everi girl watch movieth represent girl man world differ fantasi realiti shown greatli apart movi script carri power messag toward woman heard when i went cinema i felt empow selfconfidentkudo greta gerwig entir team creat vital movi womenanoth import fact actor actress absolut nail margot robbi play role well i actual convinc barbi ryan gosl absolut best facial express i enjoy watch sooo much worthi mention also awesom work actor actress they were all amaz whoever cast movi get rais everybodi manag portray charact wellon favorit scene fight ken realist actor play itand costum decorationshous also acknowledg i watch dreamhous tour youtub i appreci detail much barbi cowboy costum banger i think favourit fit entir movieand music im ken still stuck head whenev come shuffl i scream dramat but song i keep listen barbi album spotifi song catchyi realli want rewatch movi it solid im girl btw couldnt tell xd
South Park episode on an acid trip,"I really don't know what to say about this movie . Everything was colorful, the humor was there , the satire and everybody did great at what they were suppose to do . I went in there with low expectations because it's a Barbie film but I was surprised how adult the humor was and the message it got across was pretty touching . Margot Robbie as Barbie was perfect casting and the theatre was filled , everybody had a good time . I should give this score maybe a bit higher but I just felt it was just a bunch of things mashed together I was watching a parody episode of South Park which is not a bad thing , I though it was the right direction for a movie called Barbie .

What I expected and more from Greta's Barbie Movie,"I Will keep this as spoiler free as possible. When I heard Greta Gerwig was directing the Barbie movie. I was instantly excited to the fear of everyone around me. I would tell them ""Greta Gerwig wouldn't do a superficial Barbie movie it would be more, it would have message."" To my surprise it was all of that and more! It was funny and clever. It showed the problems with Barbie (the toy) but also the dreams for Barbie for young girls. It was campy in the best way. And America Ferrera's monologue deserved a standing ovation and I even teared up a few times. So please ignore the low dumb reviews and go see the movie and make up your own opinions. At least for me it was delight to be seen and I hope you feel the same.",what i expect greta barbi movi,i will keep spoiler free possibl when i heard greta gerwig direct barbi movi i instantli excit fear everyon around i would tell greta gerwig wouldnt superfici barbi movi would would messag to surpris it funni clever it show problem barbi toy also dream barbi young girl it campi best way and america ferrera monologu deserv stand ovat i even tear time so plea ignor low dumb review go see movi make opinion at least delight seen i hope feel
Family-Friendly Feel-Good Fantasy,"This goofy film skewers M/F stereotypes then addresses Existentialism, so ... yeah ... there's a hint of depth in this toy-centric fantasy.This film is worth seeing for certain gags (e.g., ""Depression Barbie"" is inspired -- could have been from an episode of Robot Chicken). Sure, it's a one-joke premise stretched into a feature-length film, but it does have its moments. Kids may not understand all of the jokes and social commentary, but that's a small price to pay for making this film a tolerable watch for adults.Margot Robbie does an excellent job of playing ""Stereotypical Barbie"" (seriously; that's her name). She puts her megawatt smile to good use, it rapidly becomes a defensive (and comically desperate) facade when she begins questioning her sanity, reality and identity, which leads to an odd spiritual journey.The casting, acting, and set pieces are all spot-on for this neon fantasy, although the pacing is a bit uneven, as if there's a need to fill time. Some dance numbers are tedious.This movie takes a brief look at what it MEANS to be human, from the POV of something that isn't. Look beneath the surface, and you might see hints of deeper themes.This rates six (6) stars in my view.",familyfriendli feelgood fantasi,thi goofi film skewer mf stereotyp address existenti yeah there hint depth toycentr fantasythi film worth see certain gag eg depress barbi inspir could episod robot chicken sure onejok premis stretch featurelength film moment kid may understand joke social commentari that small price pay make film toler watch adultsmargot robbi excel job play stereotyp barbi serious that name she put megawatt smile good use rapidli becom defens comic desper facad begin question saniti realiti ident lead odd spiritu journeyth cast act set piec spoton neon fantasi although pace bit uneven there need fill time some danc number tediousthi movi take brief look mean human pov someth isnt look beneath surfac might see hint deeper themesthi rate six star view
Barbie Review,"Released: 21st July 2023 (UK)Certificate: 12ADirector: Greta GerwigLoved by critics and the average movie goers. Film buffs like my myself will love it or hate it like marmite. Myself I'm gonna put it in my guilty pleasure list of films. I'm so glad Greta Gerwig is becoming recognised as a film director and writer because one of her previous films Lady Bird was outstanding. She is also known for acting in a great horror film Ti West's The House of the Devil and the brilliant Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs.The film was very entertaining with its hidden adult jokes and how glamorous the world of Barbie is to look at. The soundtrack will become very memorable that will eventually linger with you after the film has ended. Margot Robbie's performance as Barbie is the perfect choice, but for me I think Ryan Gosling as Ken stole the show more for me. Either way I loved them both! I think they both lead the film perfectly. It was great seeing Micheal Cera again after going under the radar for a while. I remember he was becoming a rising up actor in my college years in films like Superbad and Juno. Also it was great seeing Will Ferrell and Kate McKinnon being crazy as ever. I loved the little cameos from John Cena as Mermaid Ken and Rob Brydon as Suger Daddy Ken. Let's not forget Helen Mirren as the sassy narrator. It was really sweet seeing Rhea Perlman again too. She was great in 1996's version of Matilda as the very wacky mother.How fun the film is it does suffer from originality. The idea behind it has been done to death in films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Last Action Hero and Space Jam. Where I said it's like marmite is because there were moments that I felt like it was a bit strong on the political messages and mental health on today's society; if you are looking to watch a film for some escapism where in my opinion that's what the magic of movie experience is all about. Other than that the film is well paced with its decent runtime.",barbi review,releas st juli ukcertif adirector greta gerwiglov critic averag movi goer film buff like love hate like marmit myself im gon na put guilti pleasur list film im glad greta gerwig becom recognis film director writer one previou film ladi bird outstand she also known act great horror film ti west the hous devil brilliant we anderson isl dogsth film entertain hidden adult joke glamor world barbi look the soundtrack becom memor eventu linger film end margot robbi perform barbi perfect choic i think ryan gosl ken stole show either way i love i think lead film perfectli it great see micheal cera go radar i rememb becom rise actor colleg year film like superbad juno also great see will ferrel kate mckinnon crazi ever i love littl cameo john cena mermaid ken rob brydon suger daddi ken let forget helen mirren sassi narrat it realli sweet see rhea perlman she great version matilda wacki motherhow fun film suffer origin the idea behind done death film like who frame roger rabbit the last action hero space jam where i said like marmit moment i felt like bit strong polit messag mental health today societi look watch film escap opinion that magic movi experi other film well pace decent runtim
"Hi Barbie, Hi Ken","I am clearly not the target audience for this one but I still enjoyed it.Went and saw in the cinemas which of course added to the overall experience.Yea this is made for a younger audience and is slightly directed towards women but that doesn't mean it is one-sided or lacks depth. The character arch of Ken (Ryan Gosling) was is most enjoyable for me, he is the real star of this film. I felt the heavy anti-patriarchy angle for Barbie (Margot Robbie) was a bit ham-fisted.I will say that they couldn't of picked a better person to play Barbie, Margot Robbie just encapsulates the over-the-top nature, 'perfect look' and clueless attitude that we expect from Barbie.The only jokes I laughed at were either from Ken or Weird Barbie, I would say 90% were Ken. This isn't a bad thing more of a lack of interesting and funny characters.The cinematography and settings are amazing and stunning to look at. They did a great job at grounding Barbie World in reality but also not taking itself too seriously - very self-aware.This is a fun watch for all, lets just hope they don't bring out a sequel (pre sure they already are)",hi barbi hi ken,i clearli target audienc one i still enjoy itwent saw cinema cours ad overal experienceyea made younger audienc slightli direct toward woman doesnt mean onesid lack depth the charact arch ken ryan gosl enjoy real star film i felt heavi antipatriarchi angl barbi margot robbi bit hamfistedi say couldnt pick better person play barbi margot robbi encapsul overthetop natur perfect look clueless attitud expect barbieth joke i laugh either ken weird barbi i would say ken thi isnt bad thing lack interest funni charactersth cinematographi set amaz stun look they great job ground barbi world realiti also take serious selfawarethi fun watch let hope dont bring sequel pre sure alreadi
Blandest movie ever made.,"I've never been this disinterested in a movie before. It's the first time I fell asleep watching one even. I thought Barbie land and the « real world » were exactly the same, they were both filled with obnoxiously stupid people who think they have something special to offer. How depressing... Is this the same movie that created a worldwide event? It felt like a Barbie doll package, without the doll and accessories inside. Just a big fat ugly, dated and tacky cardboard box with beautiful colors, that don't even stick on paper. It was not funny, let alone thought provoking, or entertaining even.

And while it may not have been the best movie released on the 21st of July 2023 it certainly blew my expectations away. It was super unique and honestly one of the funniest movies I'd seen in a while. Like it did a phenomenal job of balancing its comedic element and its storytelling elements and together we're able to give out a really powerful message for men and women of all ages. And like all of the songs in this movie were unironically really good.

"Hey Twitter, lets go party!","Sorry for the title, militants, please don't cancel me! (seriously, jokes aside)
While the movie is good, I anticipate a lot of memes about overblown cancellations, prejudice, and patriarchy... which I think get a lot of attention from the script. More than was needed.The movie is fun and has great performances, hats off to Margot Robbie, but, Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu's Kens stole every scene. The rest of the acting and cast is just fine, I don't believe I've seen a single bad performance.For a particularly comedy film, I feel like my session lacked laughs. Throughout the film, I laugh in very few scenes, but I also understand that they are directed at children and so on. (ignoring the last part, there are some jokes with double meanings, nothing that children would understand, watch it calmly with the little ones!)...but I have to admit, the movie didn't get me. Actually, it was one of the few times that I almost fell asleep in the cinema. This time, me and my company, we yawned so much that we started to cry from sleep, but we didn't pass out.

Could have been soo much more,"As a young child I played with barbies. Had the house had a Ken and had the car etc but this film didn't create any humorous nostalgia at all. Soo many opportunities were missed. The looks were pretty bland and it could have been pushed soo much further. Yes there was a message but the message was relentlessly dragged on and on and everything was just, well a bit meh! The story didn't make much sense and there were no laugh out loud moments more of little ha moments that passed quickly like a pretty dull knock knock joke that you'll forget in a second. Such a shame.

Great movie,"For sure would be better rated if there weren't so many insecure men missing the entire point of the movie, or rejecting it because it is not the same old narrative that has favoured only them until now. I don't think is ""too preachy"" as other comments say. Is an important message that needs to be tackled more to have a more fair society maybe one day. Even ignoring the message, it had a good comedic approach to not just be depressed by the reality it shows, had great music, good acting, creativity, good visuals, all in all great movie. I like that it didn't have a typical love story ending, which would have ruined the whole point of the movie. A fresh movie that is needed.",great movi,for sure would better rate werent mani insecur men miss entir point movi reject old narr favour i dont think preachi comment say is import messag need tackl fair societi mayb one day even ignor messag good comed approach depress realiti show great music good act creativ good visual great movi i like didnt typic love stori end would ruin whole point movi a fresh movi need
Between matriarchy and patriarchy.,"I like F-Rating movies, to know and understand women, especially the hidden value of feminism around the story scenario, and of course there is no doubt what makes it Grate Gerwig. Although this time, there is no Saoire Ronan in my opinion is the best chemistry between directors and actresses for female films. This work Barbie, comes set in Barbieland's fantasy that depicts the irrational of a woman. The moving plot of the Barbie fantasy world, conflict increases when entering the world of reality, and the ending is resolved according to the maturity of the story, which is a red herring type of plot; what is meant is that the author diverts the audience's minds, as in this film Barbie has to correct flat soles, but it is not the essence of the Basically the director wants to convey the feminine phase, with an amazing fantasy idea, between the difference between the world of reality and the world called Barbieland.I went straight to the point, which was the first time that Barbie, like women in general, felt insecure, she realized that her feet were flat when she stepped on the sand on the beach. This is my favorite scene, because it reminds me of my childhood, when I saw my sister crying because her Barbie doll didn't stand up straight. I got the meaning from that scene, that in real events women often do not suspect their shortcomings in public places, in this film Barbie is a woman's childhood imagination playing with Barbie dolls, thus avoiding damage or defects in a doll. This adds up to Barbie's wish to go to the real world, to repair the soles of her feet, and the plot twist is that there is a childhood human, who has a barbie doll toy in the form of the main character Barbie, played by Margot Robbie. This is as if a woman will try her best to find the best treatment, in order to eliminate physical deficiencies, regardless of the morals contained in her, even though she is Margot Robbie too.The scene between the world of reality and the world of Barbie, in this case my analogy, the world of reality is represented against liberalism, and the world of Barbie is imagined conservatively, this imagination creates matriarchy in the fantasy world of Barbie by feminism, while the opposite of reality, there is control of the world of Barbie by companies acting in a patriarchal manner. Then the scene of an elderly grandmother, namely Ruth, whom Barbie first met, accidentally sat next to Ruth. My intuition at this moment, seeing the happiness of an old woman, whose beauty is faded but full of precious experiences, thinking that beauty can disappear, and that's what Barbie feels when she looks back at Ruth, and also makes Barbie aware of her question about 'death' in the musical scene at the beginning of the film . This is where Barbie's maturity signifies when she returns to Barbieland.So that at the ending point, the message of this film that describes the growth period of a woman, and the slogan ""She's everything. He's just Ken"", I interpret women as creatures that are unpredictable, experience social phenomena that occur, want to try new things until they get their point of freedom, the purpose of life is understanding everything, pride in being a complete woman who is, in expressing herself in a complex environment , especially women who live in a patriarchal environment. Finally, Barbie realized the meaning of girl, mother, grandmother, and chose to act as an independent woman without admiring men, in this case, Ken.Overall, the scenarios that are played are quite fast and do not create unnecessary scenes, the accompaniment of music to pause the audience brings the neatness of cinema that is of theatrical art value, plus sarcasm scripts that contain, in terms of the capture of the ratio of connoisseurs and comedy humor. Regarding production design, without a doubt, maybe I championed this award was obtained by Barbie at the 2024 Oscars, because from that side it really broke marketing, the pink color is like a mandatory costume for anyone who watches. I give Barbie: 7.5/100.",between matriarchi patriarchi,i like frate movi know understand woman especi hidden valu femin around stori scenario cours doubt make grate gerwig although time saoir ronan opinion best chemistri director actress femal film thi work barbi come set barbieland fantasi depict irrat woman the move plot barbi fantasi world conflict increas enter world realiti end resolv accord matur stori red her type plot meant author divert audienc mind film barbi correct flat sole essenc basic director want convey feminin phase amaz fantasi idea differ world realiti world call barbielandi went straight point first time barbi like woman gener felt insecur realiz foot flat step sand beach thi favorit scene remind childhood i saw sister cri barbi doll didnt stand straight i got mean scene real event woman often suspect shortcom public place film barbi woman childhood imagin play barbi doll thu avoid damag defect doll thi add barbi wish go real world repair sole foot plot twist childhood human barbi doll toy form main charact barbi play margot robbi thi woman tri best find best treatment order elimin physic defici regardless moral contain even though margot robbi tooth scene world realiti world barbi case analog world realiti repres liber world barbi imagin conserv imagin creat matriarchi fantasi world barbi femin opposit realiti control world barbi compani act patriarch manner then scene elderli grandmoth name ruth barbi first met accident sat next ruth my intuit moment see happi old woman whose beauti fade full preciou experi think beauti disappear that barbi feel look back ruth also make barbi awar question death music scene begin film thi barbi matur signifi return barbielandso end point messag film describ growth period woman slogan she everyth he ken i interpret woman creatur unpredict experi social phenomenon occur want tri new thing get point freedom purpos life understand everyth pride complet woman express complex environ especi woman live patriarch environ final barbi realiz mean girl mother grandmoth chose act independ woman without admir men case kenoveral scenario play quit fast creat unnecessari scene accompani music paus audienc bring neat cinema theatric art valu plu sarcasm script contain term captur ratio connoisseur comedi humor regard product design without doubt mayb i champion award obtain barbi oscar side realli broke market pink color like mandatori costum anyon watch i give barbi
Believe the hype,"Words cannot express how happy I am that the high expectations I had due to the hype were more than fulfilled. The story is beautiful, the execution makes it brilliant. I really felt the joy and energy that everyone put in to make this possible. Margot makes a perfect Barbie, but Ryan's Ken is just perfection. I really hope they will get showered with awards and recognition!The attention to detail is stunning. The movie often shows such iconic elements that kids that played with Barbies immediately recognize. In my opinion they did a great job on balancing the fact that they are dolls, but they are still played by real people.Some points of critique: at times the pace felt rushed, for my mother depending on subtitles combined with the visual pace, it was not always easy for her to follow. I was expecting a lot more fashion from Barbie, it seemed that Ken was more in focus on serving the looks.

Barbie and the meaning of life,"Barbie is a story of a Barbie gaining sentience when her owner hits a bad time affecting her life in BarbieLand. She develops human feelings and tries to come to term with it by meeting her humans whilst forced to string along her Ken. Ken sees the real world, he to finds more things that can be of his benefit, WHILE Barbie falls into much deeper bad time. Ruckus happens as the Mattel Company AND Barbie tries to make thing back to what it is used to be.A very well conceptualized film about Barbie and her plight of finding the meaning of life. I think this is a great idea BUT clearly there are things that can be better.Loved mostly its darker and dramatic moments. Gerwig wrestling the ideas of Barbie both in the Feminist context and the how the public sees it at large was a masterclass. It is where the story really held its landing. YOU could see how Barbie both as an idea and a product, comes to term of how she affected the culture or just how the culture at large move ahead. The scene with Ruth and Barbie is so well placed in the script.But for the mixed parts of the film, I felt more mixed with the comedic aspect of the film. The script was fun but verbally the schtick can be quite repetitive. It also was not that witty at times AND pass quirkiness as such. It was not. Visually, its funnier though but a lot of the jokes can be a hit or miss. I do not think Gerwig understood HOW TO END it with the Ken's BUT practically its her nodding the first wave Feminist, by them maybe trying to get the fundamental rights first before going all out but without any repurcussion for the Ken Movement.I also did not like how anti-climactic the Un-Kendollification of the Barbie's was. The grand standing gesture was just repeated too much, that it kinda loses a lot of its power but I guess it was to make sense of the plans for the Ken's afterward.Acting wise definitely, I think Gosling did the best with the comedic material, with Robbie excelling in more dramatic portion of the film. Not as impressed with the others except maybe for McKinnon's weird Barbie and Issa Rae as President Barbie, which both has moments but too small to really be noteworthy.I think it is definitely overhyped AND was meant for children BUT Gerwig did great with all the hoopla she had faced to make this film, especially with its themes of Female Identity AND Barbie herself, the portion of the film I think it had its best success. Robbie deserves the accolades as she brings to life Barbie. Gosling was also good as the very much confused Ken. 3.5/5.",barbi mean life,barbi stori barbi gain sentienc owner hit bad time affect life barbieland she develop human feel tri come term meet human whilst forc string along ken ken see real world find thing benefit while barbi fall much deeper bad time rucku happen mattel compani and barbi tri make thing back use bea well conceptu film barbi plight find mean life i think great idea but clearli thing betterlov mostli darker dramat moment gerwig wrestl idea barbi feminist context public see larg masterclass it stori realli held land you could see barbi idea product come term affect cultur cultur larg move ahead the scene ruth barbi well place scriptbut mix part film i felt mix comed aspect film the script fun verbal schtick quit repetit it also witti time and pas quirki it visual funnier though lot joke hit miss i think gerwig understood how to end ken but practic nod first wave feminist mayb tri get fundament right first go without repurcuss ken movementi also like anticlimact unkendollif barbi the grand stand gestur repeat much kinda lose lot power i guess make sen plan ken afterwardact wise definit i think gosl best comed materi robbi excel dramat portion film not impress other except mayb mckinnon weird barbi issa rae presid barbi moment small realli noteworthyi think definit overhyp and meant child but gerwig great hoopla face make film especi theme femal ident and barbi portion film i think best success robbi deserv accolad bring life barbi gosl also good much confus ken
Very fun goofy movie,"Unlike most movies that come out,
Barbie is a fun adaptation and an excellent movie.There is no serious tension in the movie, nor does it have a thrilling storyline but it's just a goofy movie and that's why it can't be compared to normal movies.It's sort of like Tom and Jerry the movie that came out a few years ago, the first live action adaptation. There aren't many movies like it.The acting is phenomenal to play the stereotypical characters from the barbie universe and the jokes are brutally honest and also funny.This movie takes a turn from the regular sci-fi movies that come out on a daily basis and is a recommended watch for family time as well as people looking for something aside from the norm.",veri fun goofi movi,unlik movi come barbi fun adapt excel moviether seriou tension movi thrill storylin goofi movi that cant compar normal moviesit sort like tom jerri movi came year ago first live action adapt there arent mani movi like itth act phenomen play stereotyp charact barbi univers joke brutal honest also funnythi movi take turn regular scifi movi come daili basi recommend watch famili time well peopl look someth asid norm
Not much plot,"I totally get it. The themes, the message, the irony. It's just I expected way more of an actual story and to come full circle but it just left me feeling odd.Positives: The film is beautiful and there's many laugh out loud moments. Both my partner and I did on many occasions. I liked the change from barbie land to real life. I liked the shock at seeing how much of a man's world we live in.Negatives: I found the endless cameos and useless one liners really odd. From Will Farrells colleagues just popping up for one word to celebrities constantly saying 'hey barbie, bye barbie'. It just felt so odd.The ending seemed to not really finish the movie. For me, I expected when the barbies got their homes back they'd then start a new way of life where they share with the Kens. Instead of going straight back to female only or female led spaces. Isn't that just as oppressive as the misogyny they're against in the real world? So they've not learnt from the events that have happened.As well as the montage section I really didn't get that bit and I'm a 33yo female.Maybe I set my expectations too high from all the hype. I would actually like to watch the movie again to see if I still feel the same.",not much plot,i total get the theme messag ironi it i expect way actual stori come full circl left feel oddposit the film beauti there mani laugh loud moment both partner i mani occas i like chang barbi land real life i like shock see much man world live inneg i found endless cameo useless one liner realli odd from will farrel colleagu pop one word celebr constantli say hey barbi bye barbi it felt oddth end seem realli finish movi for i expect barbi got home back theyd start new way life share ken instead go straight back femal femal led space isnt oppress misogyni theyr real world so theyv learnt event happeneda well montag section i realli didnt get bit im yo femalemayb i set expect high hype i would actual like watch movi see i still feel

Good Movie,"Rating: 8.1
Overall, a feminist powerhouse of a movie as Greta Gerwig exceeded my expectations to create a very fun movie to watch as it is filled with an enjoyable cast, funny jokes, and memorable production design, costumes, and soundtrack as the movie tells many different messages about self-image and societal power, even though it is very on-the-nose about it and does not tie up all the loose ends.Good Direction (Although she does stick to her typical style of filmmaking, she uses a more palatable style of storytelling that incorporates meta humor that does not take itself too seriously to tell her messages; she builds both the Barbie World and the Real World very well; she gets a good amount from her actors (even though it is just so stupid at times what she has them do, an aspect that I kinda enjoyed, to be honest)), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Margot Robbie (Uses more of her experience as an actor and celebrity to play the role as she polls from many aspects of her career to create a multi-dimensional version of a once very shallow character), Very Good from Ryan Gosling (The real comedic relief of the movie as he steals the show in all his scenes with how silly and stupid he is; he is also a big driver of morality throughout the movie as he shows how the oppressed feel once they gain some ounce of power), Good from America Ferrera (Does well in her scenes and acts as the moral compass throughout the movie (bridging the divide between the Barbies and the Kens)), Pretty Good from Kate McKinnon (Plays the typical role she is used to playing), Pretty Good to Good from Michael Cera (The role of Allan was specifically written for him and he did his best embodying it), Pretty Good from Ariana Greenblatt (Plays her role well and acts as the youthful voice in the movie), Pretty Good from Simu Liu, Pretty Good from Issa Rae, Pretty Good from Rhea Perlman, Pretty Good to Good from Will Ferrell (Uses his experience as it is as if the role was written for him), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (Pretty simplistic overall as it follows a pretty standard template but it pays homage to many different movies and is laid out well; the ending was pretty predictable though (and kinda feels like they didn't close up some of the messages they were trying to present)), Good Screenplay (Dialogue flows well (even though it is a bit on the nose/meta); jokes were surprisingly funny and helped make swallowing the message easier; the symbols and messages of the movie are taught throughout the movie and done so in a very easy way to understand given how overt they were (which is good cause there are surprisingly many nuances to them despite the subject matter/how it is told); foreshadowing was somewhat there but not as good as it could have been), Pretty Good Score/Very Good Soundtrack (More of a soundtrack than a score-based movie), Good to Very Good Cinematography (Really enjoyed the shots they used in Barbieland as it helps give it a cartoony yet cheap feel), Good Sound, Very Good Editing (Really enjoyed the assembly line shots in Barbieland as it helped give it a simulation feel), Good Visual Effects, Great Production Design (Really what makes the movie as the sets were great to look at with its cheap feel and how pink they were (giving a very big doll-house vibe)), Very Good to Great Costumes (Really help give the Barbie feel of the movie as they fit the doll vibe and help bring color and flavor to the movie), Plot Structure was pretty simplistic overall as it follows a pretty standard template (similar to that of a coming-of-age/trying to save your village type of movie), Pacing was good as it was not too fast or slow (no need to cut or add any content), Climax was decently executed as it shows some resolution in the conflict (but it does not do that great of a job tying up all the loose ends as it feels kinda forced), Tone was very cartoony/Barbie as it did a really good job at establishing this throughout the movie; there were also many different flavors of Greta Gerwig's style that were mixed throughout this movie.",good movi,rate overal feminist powerhous movi greta gerwig exceed expect creat fun movi watch fill enjoy cast funni joke memor product design costum soundtrack movi tell mani differ messag selfimag societ power even though onthenos tie loo endsgood direct although stick typic style filmmak use palat style storytel incorpor meta humor take serious tell messag build barbi world real world well get good amount actor even though stupid time aspect i kinda enjoy honest pretti good good act good veri good margot robbi use experi actor celebr play role poll mani aspect career creat multidimension version shallow charact veri good ryan gosl the real comed relief movi steal show scene silli stupid also big driver moral throughout movi show oppress feel gain ounc power good america ferrera doe well scene act moral compass throughout movi bridg divid barbi ken pretti good kate mckinnon play typic role use play pretti good good michael cera the role allan specif written best embodi pretti good ariana greenblatt play role well act youth voic movi pretti good simu liu pretti good issa rae pretti good rhea perlman pretti good good will ferrel use experi role written pretti good rest cast pretti good stori pretti simplist overal follow pretti standard templat pay homag mani differ movi laid well end pretti predict though kinda feel like didnt close messag tri present good screenplay dialogu flow well even though bit nosemeta joke surprisingli funni help make swallow messag easier symbol messag movi taught throughout movi done easi way understand given overt good caus surprisingli mani nuanc despit subject matterhow told foreshadow somewhat good could pretti good scoreveri good soundtrack more soundtrack scorebas movi good veri good cinematographi realli enjoy shot use barbieland help give cartooni yet cheap feel good sound veri good edit realli enjoy assembl line shot barbieland help give simul feel good visual effect great product design realli make movi set great look cheap feel pink give big dollhous vibe veri good great costum realli help give barbi feel movi fit doll vibe help bring color flavor movi plot structur pretti simplist overal follow pretti standard templat similar comingofagetri save villag type movi pace good fast slow need cut add content climax decent execut show resolut conflict great job tie loo end feel kinda forc tone cartoonybarbi realli good job establish throughout movi also mani differ flavor greta gerwig style mix throughout movi
Suffers from being a multi-faceted movie but still worth your time,"As I stated in the title of this review first and foremost this movie is absolutely worth your time, especially with a rather short run-time that is an hour and fifty minutes.This movie has a ton of soul behind it and it shows, many of the scenes are just fantastically made and you could feel they aren't just corporate copy-paste pieces made to create a film.However, I do feel like Barbie suffers from the same issues that movies like 'Jojo Rabbit' do, while having the movie have a non-serious feel to it at times and switching it around certain scenes it really diminishes the value of both sides.Despite this, this movie is still Kenough like all of us.",suffer multifacet movi still worth time,a i state titl review first foremost movi absolut worth time especi rather short runtim hour fifti minutesthi movi ton soul behind show mani scene fantast made could feel arent corpor copypast piec made creat filmhowev i feel like barbi suffer issu movi like jojo rabbit movi nonseri feel time switch around certain scene realli diminish valu sidesdespit movi still kenough like u

"Wrapped in Plastic, It's Fantastic","After years and years of development and casting changes, the live action Barbie movie is finally out for the whole world to see. Co-written and directed by actor turned filmmaker Greta Gerwig and co-produced by and starring Margot Robbie as the titular doll, the film has proven to be one of the most anticipated summer blockbusters of 2023 and a welcome anniversary present to Warner Bros' 100th year since their inception. Now that the film is out for the public and media to enjoy, the best way to describe it is a hysterically subversive commentary on feminism disguised as a cheesy fantasy comedy.The film follows Stereotypical Barbie and Ken going on a journey of self-discovery following an existential crisis, all the while encountering people who either want to make or break the doll's spirits. Before going into the story itself, the ensemble cast must be addressed, especially Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the primary Barbie and Ken respectively. In addition to sharing witty chemistry with each other, the multiple Barbies and Kens around Barbieland showcase the blessings of multiple roles for women to take on and a curse in how that can influence the men around them to call the shots. Alongside them is America Ferrera as Mattel employee Gloria who has as much to do with Barbie's existential crisis as she does in trying to repair her distant daughter Sasha stuck in her grumpy teen phase, showcasing how different generations operate around the famous Barbie line of toy making. Alongside many other well known names like Will Ferrell and Rhea Perlman as two differentiating role models for women around the world, the ensemble cast is exactly what will draw butts into seats.Now as far as the film itself is concerned, the biggest contributing factor to how outlandish it is is that its worldbuilding makes no sense at all. Barbieland is supposed to be the place where all the Barbies and Kens live their lives to the fullest, yet the real world is interlinked based on how people have played with them. That being said, since the film is meant to highlight the conflicting views of feminism in a still patriarchal society, the imaginative execution of how the dolls and people interact makes for a lot of eye opening politics centered around how complicated the world truly is. While it's difficult to say if the film hit all of its targets, especially when the politics it tackles are still relevant today, its humor and commentary lies in the blending of childhood nostalgia and adult intellectualism. This is what partially leads to Barbie's wanting to leave her ""perfect"" paradise and Ken's attempts to see Barbie for who he pretends to be. Who could have thought a Barbie movie would have reminded us how difficult it is to face having to hide who we truly are out of pressure?Of course, the production and costume design are what truly stand out around this ambitious feature. In contrast to the mundane real world, Barbieland is composed of bright colors and make-believe dream houses, complete with a wide variety of diverse costumes and elaborate sets making up the surreal fantasy landscape. As the Barbies function through pretend toy logic, there are some amusing visual gags based on their imaginary lifestyles and how they appear based on what their owners and Mattel did to them in the long run. The addition of much cartoony stunt work makes the film even more hilarious when you realize how little logic is actually in the film depending on the universe. Next to Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt lending their talents to an accompanying score and amusing musical numbers, one can sense a true glance of nostalgia with many well known hit songs that contribute to the film's tone and commercial exploitation. It's hard to say if the film is a jukebox musical or not, but it certainly is a riot with how much the audience will jive to the beat of the tunes.In a day and age where we seem to be forgetting how much fun movies can truly be, Greta Gerwig's Barbie is a wonderful reminder as to why it's ok to embrace your inner child in a world overrun with societal beatdowns and forced maturity. Whether or not you've ever been into the Barbie toy line, this film is an absolute must watch for both the casual filmgoer and fans of hysterical fantasy comedies. It is self aware enough to make us laugh at even the smallest of jokes, it is mature enough to embrace its own immaturity, and it is a reason to still support the hard working crew with how the film industry is going nowadays.",wrap plastic it fantast,after year year develop cast chang live action barbi movi final whole world see cowritten direct actor turn filmmak greta gerwig coproduc star margot robbi titular doll film proven one anticip summer blockbust welcom anniversari present warner bro th year sinc incept now film public medium enjoy best way describ hyster subvers commentari femin disguis cheesi fantasi comedyth film follow stereotyp barbi ken go journey selfdiscoveri follow existenti crisi encount peopl either want make break doll spirit befor go stori ensembl cast must address especi robbi ryan gosl primari barbi ken respect in addit share witti chemistri multipl barbi ken around barbieland showcas bless multipl role woman take cur influenc men around call shot alongsid america ferrera mattel employe gloria much barbi existenti crisi tri repair distant daughter sasha stuck grumpi teen phase showcas differ gener oper around famou barbi line toy make alongsid mani well known name like will ferrel rhea perlman two differenti role model woman around world ensembl cast exactli draw butt seatsnow far film concern biggest contribut factor outlandish worldbuild make sen barbieland suppos place barbi ken live live fullest yet real world interlink base peopl play that said sinc film meant highlight conflict view femin still patriarch societi imagin execut doll peopl interact make lot eye open polit center around complic world truli while difficult say film hit target especi polit tackl still relev today humor commentari lie blend childhood nostalgia adult intellectu thi partial lead barbi want leav perfect paradis ken attempt see barbi pretend who could thought barbi movi would remind u difficult face hide truli pressureof cours product costum design truli stand around ambiti featur in contrast mundan real world barbieland compos bright color makebeliev dream hous complet wide varieti diver costum elabor set make surreal fantasi landscap a barbi function pretend toy logic amus visual gag base imaginari lifestyl appear base owner mattel long run the addit much cartooni stunt work make film even hilari realiz littl logic actual film depend univers next mark ronson andrew wyatt lend talent accompani score amus music number one sen true glanc nostalgia mani well known hit song contribut film tone commerci exploit it hard say film jukebox music certainli riot much audienc jive beat tunesin day age seem forget much fun movi truli greta gerwig barbi wonder remind ok embrac inner child world overrun societ beatdown forc matur whether youv ever barbi toy line film absolut must watch casual filmgoer fan hyster fantasi comedi it self awar enough make u laugh even smallest joke matur enough embrac immatur reason still support hard work crew film industri go nowaday
Beautiful and hilarious - third act stumbles,"The much anticipated Barbie movie. It's unreal to see a packed theatre 3 weeks after release, what a summer for movies.This film was so much fun. I had a perpetual grin on my face the entire two hours, only growing wider with every joke. I'm glad I experienced it in a theatre setting, laughing along with others is a great feeling - and there was plenty of laughs to go around. Genuinely one of the funniest films I've seen in a while, the adult-targeted cultural/societal humour really, really worked. Theres not much to say about the set design, costume dept., hair, makeup, and sets other than its nothing short of awe-inspiring. The production design is pretty much flawless. Also, the movie references and homage payed to classics like 2001 and the Matrix was very, very much appreciated. My only complaint would be the third act of the film. I feel like the fast, satirical humour of the first two acts worked perfectly, challenging and poking fun at cultural, societal and political norms, but doing so in a clever way which serves the story and script - gracefully. The third act throws this creative ingenuity out the window by way of heavy handed, in-your-face monologues.",beauti hilari third act stumbl,the much anticip barbi movi it unreal see pack theatr week releas summer moviesthi film much fun i perpetu grin face entir two hour grow wider everi joke im glad i experienc theatr set laugh along other great feel plenti laugh go around genuin one funniest film ive seen adulttarget culturalsociet humour realli realli work there much say set design costum dept hair makeup set noth short aweinspir the product design pretti much flawless also movi refer homag pay classic like matrix much appreci my complaint would third act film i feel like fast satir humour first two act work perfectli challeng poke fun cultur societ polit norm clever way serv stori script grace the third act throw creativ ingenu window way heavi hand inyourfac monologu

The parallels between the professions of the Barbies and reversals - reflects how we've gone from Mary Richards to ... well you know.Greta Gerwig has taken every facet of the human condition and put a pink glow on it.I laughed, I pondered and I cried.

Better than Oppenheimer,"This is by far not the perfect movie, but I enjoyed it more than Oppenheimer, which I was not able to finish.This movie is definitely head above a lot of other media in terms of attention to little details and the costumes. Loved this side of it, and I remember seeing lots of YouTube videos that went over all the details and how they are connected to real life or to other media. It also has a really good pacing, and overall feels more like an adult fairytale. Which may not be something for everyone, obviously.I remember when it just came out a lot of people were praising the show for how females are portrayed, and bashed it for how males are portrayed. And there were some who did the reverse. I would say that both sides are correct. Not to go too much into details, patriarchy is depicted as the evil of the world, and matriarchy is the only way to save it. This is not only not true, but it is also shallow, and ignoring real examples of matriarchic rule.At the same time, the movie does touch upon real issues that men face in real life, like the need to fight for even a slither of attention. This is good, but it gets kind of brushed off at the end, almost as if it did not matter, that that's what brought about Kendome. ""Kenough"" shirt is a good message, but it gets overpowered by the main message, that it is enough for women to just be ordinary. Which is also a good message, but...
The movie just forgot that in reality you need equality. You need both sides to be present and finding common ground. It is ok to be ordinary for both sides, and both sides can do amazing things. To be honest, for more than first half of the movie, I thought that would be the final message, but in the end it was muddied by ""women are better"", which felt disingenuous and worsened overall experience. The final scene, though did even more damage, but maybe I just did not get it, since I am a guy.Either way, it was more or less an enjoyable experience. Overhyped? Probably yes. Worth a watch? Also, probably yes, if you temper your expectations.",better oppenheim,thi far perfect movi i enjoy oppenheim i abl finishthi movi definit head lot medium term attent littl detail costum love side i rememb see lot youtub video went detail connect real life medium it also realli good pace overal feel like adult fairytal which may someth everyon obviouslyi rememb came lot peopl prais show femal portray bash male portray and revers i would say side correct not go much detail patriarchi depict evil world matriarchi way save thi true also shallow ignor real exampl matriarch ruleat time movi touch upon real issu men face real life like need fight even slither attent thi good get kind brush end almost matter that brought kendom kenough shirt good messag get overpow main messag enough woman ordinari which also good messag the movi forgot realiti need equal you need side present find common ground it ok ordinari side side amaz thing to honest first half movi i thought would final messag end muddi woman better felt disingenu worsen overal experi the final scene though even damag mayb i get sinc i guyeith way le enjoy experi overhyp probabl ye worth watch also probabl ye temper expect
Speechless,"Words cannot express successfully how I feel about this movie. I want to first say how important this movie is for women in the industry. As a woman who's dream is to be a filmmaker and being so young this is a monumental achievement in my eyes. This movie has made me excited to see what younger minds can do. It has a wonderful creative voice and a beautiful mix of comedy and respectfully addresses hard topics in a way that I think everyone can benefit from. I can understand how some people find it preachy but I disagree because this is a love letter to women. There are so many things that stuck with me and I will probably remember forever. I am impressed with the amount or detail, creativity, and love that was so obviously put into this movie. Greta Gerwig and the rest of the production team did a beautiful job creating an immersive thought provoking experience that brought me to tears. This is by far Margot and Ryan's best performance I've seen and they deserve all the love for it. The sci-fi references are also a very interesting touch that I didn't expect. I think this is a movie than everyone can take something away from and it is very special to me.",speechless,word express success i feel movi i want first say import movi woman industri a woman who dream filmmak young monument achiev eye thi movi made excit see younger mind it wonder creativ voic beauti mix comedi respect address hard topic way i think everyon benefit i understand peopl find preachi i disagre love letter woman there mani thing stuck i probabl rememb forev i impress amount detail creativ love obvious put movi greta gerwig rest product team beauti job creat immers thought provok experi brought tear thi far margot ryan best perform ive seen deserv love the scifi refer also interest touch i didnt expect i think movi everyon take someth away special
The name is what brings people in....,"6.7/10Well, that went as well I imagined it would. There's nothing crazy or fantastical about this movie. I laughed a few times. I tried to go in with an open mind despite the gripes about the film.Firstly, this part is not meant to be deep. Just what I observed on a surface perspective. The message. This is probably the biggest gripe people have had from what I've seen. It's been done before, and better, only this time Barbie is the face. My conclusion was that both Barbie and need to find who they are in this crazy world. They need to do it in a way that doesn't put the other down, or alienate the other into believing they are or aren't good enough to accomplish something.Margot Robbie continues to be one of my favourite actresses. She did a splendid job as Barbie. Ryan Gosling as Ken is where things got iffy for me. He made it work, but I think his success comes with Simu Liu as his opposite. Without Simu Liu, Gosling (ten years older than me) is just the awkward old guy trying to maintain his youth.Visually the film was great. It felt like a world of make believe, and plastic. The graphics used to create certain scenes worked well, and didn't feel more fake than what they were meant to be. I actually loved the soundtrack for the film. Some really good songs, and while it's put in as a remix, it was nice that ""Barbie Girl"" made the cut. The pacing is steady and the two hours runtime flew by.Overall, an enjoyable and entertaining film. I would say it's worth checking out. Definitely, and obviously, geared towards women more so. Acting, cinematography, and sound are all good. I am convinced however that if Barbie was not the face. This film would not have made $1bn. Cause it's definitely not that good.That's all for now.

"Wow, this was so bad! Dont trust the good reviews!!!","OMG, how bad is this? 3/10 is a good rating for a movie like this one compared to a GOOD MOVIE!Cant belive people like this. The whole thing lacked a strong story and any sort of narrative impetus. It really was very tedious, with same scene content played over and over again.The styling was good as was some of the dance routines and doll movements from the cast but even this got tiresome.The cast tried their best with the material, but to my mind Margot Robbie has done two duff movies in a row, this and Babylon. I am being to think she lacks good judgement and any acting heft.In terms of other reviewers on here, they were watching a different movie and judging the vague thematic material as a plus because it looked out the power dynamic between men and women, forgetting the exploration undertaken in this movie was a historical perspective from the 1960's, when Barbie was invented and really had little application in 2023.In summation it was style over substance, it lacked humour and story and indeed anything memorable. At best this is a 3 outta 10 for the dance sequences.",wow bad dont trust good review,omg bad good rate movi like one compar good moviec beliv peopl like the whole thing lack strong stori sort narr impetu it realli tediou scene content play againth style good danc routin doll movement cast even got tiresometh cast tri best materi mind margot robbi done two duff movi row babylon i think lack good judgement act heftin term review watch differ movi judg vagu themat materi plu look power dynam men woman forget explor undertaken movi histor perspect barbi invent realli littl applic in summat style substanc lack humour stori inde anyth memor at best outta danc sequenc
Everything I expected and more.,"I wanted a girly movie with humor, amazing looks, and a feminist plot. A true show for the ladies. And this gave me that and more. So many profound moments, so many funny lines, such good acting, the cinematography was beautiful, the sets were perfect, the outfits were on point. First girls movie I love with no overt emphasis on a romantic relationship. Just a beautiful, complex, funny story about barbie. Everyone was perfectly casted. I was nervous about all the young children in the audience but there was no sexual scenes, little cursing, and most innuendo seemed to go over their heads.

A Whirlwind Journey to Self-Discovery,"Barbie (2023) offers a vibrant and empowering cinematic experience, delving deep into the themes of women empowerment and self-discovery. The movie serves as a poignant reminder of the valuable lessons it imparts to its audience. Through an engaging narrative, the film explores the resilience and strength of its characters, particularly Barbie, as they navigate the complexities of the world around them.The movie's strengths lie in its exceptional cast and impeccable direction. The actors bring their characters to life with remarkable depth, making it easy for the audience to connect with their journeys. The attention to detail in the Barbie world is awe-inspiring, capturing the essence of the beloved toy and its universe. Every frame is meticulously crafted, mirroring the way real-life enthusiasts play with their Barbie dolls.However, the film's climax leaves something to be desired. The resolution feels somewhat abrupt, leaving the audience yearning for a more satisfying conclusion. It's akin to being left in the middle of a captivating story, with questions lingering in the air. While the movie successfully conveys its message, the execution of the final act could have been more polished to provide a more fulfilling viewing experience.One of the movie's standout moments involves Barbie's venture into the real world, showcasing her bravery and determination as she strives to make a difference. Yet, despite the film's best efforts, this pivotal moment lacks the emotional connection needed to truly resonate with the audience. The resolution of their struggles and the restoration of happiness, although achieved, feel somewhat disconnected, leaving viewers wanting more closure.In the grand scheme of things, Barbie (2023) stands as a commendable cinematic creation, not without its flaws but brimming with potential. The film earns praise for its outstanding performances, meticulous direction, and faithful portrayal of the Barbie universe. While it may not reach the heights of a cinematic masterpiece, it undoubtedly serves as a thought-provoking and visually captivating piece of storytelling.In conclusion, I would rate Barbie (2023) a 7 out of 10. It might not achieve perfection, but it offers a unique and engaging perspective, making it a must-watch for enthusiasts and curious minds alike. Give it a chance; you might find yourself pleasantly surprised and, perhaps, even inspired.Thank you for reading my review.

"Didn't live up,to the hype.","I think the extensive hype and the long standing popularity of the Barbie brand are responsible for bringing several generations of fans into the theaters resulting in the opening sales. It certainly isn't the movie, itself. The storyline was overly simplistic, poorly written and I didn't find its style of absurd humor to be funny. The movie relied a lot on sight gags that I thought fell flat. The ending seemed to come out of the blue and was a poor attempt at profundity. Margot Robbie IS the consummate Barbie, but she pretty much plays ""actress Barbie"" in everything she does, so it wasn't anything groundbreaking for her. I thought Gloria and Sasha were the best characters and the combination of their performances along with the costumes and sets are the reason I gave the movie any stars at all. The concept of patriarchy certainly isn't anything new and IMO there are much better films on the subject - starting with any of the Jane Austin films and this director's other film - Little Women.",didnt live upto hype,i think extens hype long stand popular barbi brand respons bring sever gener fan theater result open sale it certainli isnt movi the storylin overli simplist poorli written i didnt find style absurd humor funni the movi reli lot sight gag i thought fell flat the end seem come blue poor attempt profund margot robbi is consumm barbi pretti much play actress barbi everyth wasnt anyth groundbreak i thought gloria sasha best charact combin perform along costum set reason i gave movi star the concept patriarchi certainli isnt anyth new imo much better film subject start jane austin film director film littl woman
Fantastic Journey To The Plastic World,"Barbie may seem like a kids movie at a glance but its more than that. Even though kids are going to love it (no doubt) this movie is specifically made for adults who used to play with the original Barbies. The Barbies that were shown in the movie being exact same as our own childhood dolls takes you back in the past.Margot Robbie's every single action, either crying and laying down on floor or smiling while kissing, is exactly same as a Barbie doll.America Farrera's monologue deserves multiple nominations. She stole the show. Simu Liu was fantastic in it and actually made me sad for Ryan Gosling's Ken.Ken Song is another masterpiece of this movie but it's not as iconic as Will Ferrel calling himself the 'mother' but the best part about the movie was including and remembering Ruth, the founder of Barbie, and her daughter Barbara.The movie broke the wall in unexpected ways, it's classic comedy direct to audience was one of the many great aspects that I loved.Even though I expected a better ending for Ken and other Barbies the movie ended on a happy note which delighted me.",fantast journey to the plastic world,barbi may seem like kid movi glanc even though kid go love doubt movi specif made adult use play origin barbi the barbi shown movi exact childhood doll take back pastmargot robbi everi singl action either cri lay floor smile kiss exactli barbi dollamerica farrera monologu deserv multipl nomin she stole show simu liu fantast actual made sad ryan gosl kenken song anoth masterpiec movi icon will ferrel call mother best part movi includ rememb ruth founder barbi daughter barbarath movi broke wall unexpect way classic comedi direct audienc one mani great aspect i lovedeven though i expect better end ken barbi movi end happi note delight
"doesn't neatly tie it all up into a bow, but does have entertainment value","Viewers are plunged into the sunny, candy-coated world of Barbieland, where Stereotypical Barbie enjoys her idyllic life, until she's abruptly struck with an existential crisis. With dopey Ken as her companion, Barbie journeys to Real World where, not to put too fine a point on it, things are just irrevocably messed up. Greta Gerwig's glossy, sparkly, splashy, musical satire offers up dazzling visual eye candy, with double entendres, clever and funny critiques of consumerism, femininity, mansplaining, and the hierarchical system. Opens with such flash and snap, until it veers off and stumbles over itself trying to hammer home its message while searching for a real plot, and then reverts into some formulaic battle between the matriarchy and patriarchy with shifting sympathies that actually confuse its themes. Nonetheless, an obsequiously grinning from ear to ear Robbie is ideally cast, but so is daft, superfluous Gosling making it hard to deny. **½",doesnt neatli tie bow entertain valu,viewer plung sunni candyco world barbieland stereotyp barbi enjoy idyl life she abruptli struck existenti crisi with dopey ken companion barbi journey real world put fine point thing irrevoc mess greta gerwig glossi sparkli splashi music satir offer dazzl visual eye candi doubl entendr clever funni critiqu consumer feminin mansplain hierarch system open flash snap veer stumbl tri hammer home messag search real plot revert formula battl matriarchi patriarchi shift sympathi actual confus theme nonetheless obsequi grin ear ear robbi ideal cast daft superflu gosl make hard deni
Fun and not overly complicated,"I know there's been concern that the movie will be overly feminist because it was written by Greta Grewig. This movie manages to capture the right amount of feminism without taking itself so seriously. The standout performance is Ryan Gosling as Ken; I think he carried his role with the perfect amount of Kenergy. Margot Robbie is delightful as Barbie and gives her much heart.I think the movie would've worked better as a tv series to allow the writers to flesh out the characters a bit more. It would've been better if we understood more of what created the distance between Gloria and her daughter (See? I can't even remember her name). When did Barbie first start feeling that she wanted more than the same existence everyday. Why weren't the Barbies and Kens capable of understanding more than their world? Didn't their characters encompass their human counterparts?Anyway....the movie was fun, lighthearted and something for everyone to enjoy.",fun overli complic,i know there concern movi overli feminist written greta grewig thi movi manag captur right amount femin without take serious the standout perform ryan gosl ken i think carri role perfect amount kenergi margot robbi delight barbi give much hearti think movi wouldv work better tv seri allow writer flesh charact bit it wouldv better understood creat distanc gloria daughter see i cant even rememb name when barbi first start feel want exist everyday whi werent barbi ken capabl understand world didnt charact encompass human counterpartsanywayth movi fun lightheart someth everyon enjoy
APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY -- years ahead of its time,"Barbie is absolutely brilliant! Studio executives would do well to grasp the fundamental reason for its success -- speaking truth to the viewer's subconscious psychology. I have yet to see a single review which acknowledges this, presumably because psychology and political rhetoric (from both sides) are received with equal disdain in contemporary American society -- despite the reality that psychology is a valid modern science.Barbie poses fundamental questions of:
""who am I?""
""Why do I identify myself as something?""
""What causes me to feel the way I do?""Greta Gerwig is phenomenally genius in anthrapamorphizing these and other human psychological issues onto the inanimate object of a plastic doll. It is analogous to an adult version of Pinocchio. This far exceeds the psychological expression for which Kubrik aspired -- as she extolled in the opening sequence. Kubrik's last work was A. I., which raised but did not answer similar questions. Clearly, the world has spoken with its pocketbook, and is now ready to hear about applied psychology and ""emotional intelligence"" -- simply because that is the only way forward with 8 Billion Earthlings, in balance rather than perpetual conflict.Many reviews find the points made in the movie to be repetitive. However, most people do not ""get it"" the first time, and need to perceive it from differing perspectives.",appli psycholog year ahead time,barbi absolut brilliant studio execut would well grasp fundament reason success speak truth viewer subconsci psycholog i yet see singl review acknowledg presum psycholog polit rhetor side receiv equal disdain contemporari american societi despit realiti psycholog valid modern sciencebarbi pose fundament question i whi i identifi someth what caus feel way i dogreta gerwig phenomen geniu anthrapamorph human psycholog issu onto inanim object plastic doll it analog adult version pinocchio thi far exce psycholog express kubrik aspir extol open sequenc kubrik last work a i rais answer similar question clearli world spoken pocketbook readi hear appli psycholog emot intellig simpli way forward billion earthl balanc rather perpetu conflictmani review find point made movi repetit howev peopl get first time need perceiv differ perspect
Barbie is fun!,"As a skeptical viewer, I went into this expecting cheesy bad. I am happy to say that this movie is fun! Is it for everyone? Absolutely not. It's a great mixture of adult humor and fun and kids humor and fun without ever feeling like it dives into one or the other too much. There's surprisingly a beautiful emotional sequence TWICE and it delivers a great message while poking fun at Barbie and Mattel. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling prove to be the amazing actors they are known for and this is packed with a great supporting cast.

Another Greta masterpiece,"Never have I ever experienced this much fun during a movie. Every actor played its part perfectly. With enough self-awerness, humour and silly moments this was everything I hoped for. The budget was also insane, I can't wait to rewatch this so I can look at all the details again. The way Barbie moves, walks, drinks, acts?? Perfection.Also surprisingly emotional, I didn't expect to cry during a movie about a doll.

A Barbie world,"Another movie based on a famous toy, now based on Barbie dolls from the toy company Mattel; I do not love Barbie toys, but I do not hate them either. The movie Barbie (2023) was surprisingly good with it being funny and having a good message; other than the interesting premise to the movie, there is great casting with Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken. Another draw to this movie for me other than the premise and the casting, was the design and the look of the movie looking like a Barbie playset with the look of Barbieland and the amount of pink and the use of life-sized plastic props used like in Barbie toy sets.I could not think of anyone else to play the role of the main Barbie other than Margot Robbie, because she is great in the role with Barbie having an existential crisis about herself, and herself changing like her feet being flat on the ground instead of on tippy toes; she was funny and likable with her trying to find what human is playing with her doll in the real world. Ryan Gosling as Ken was funny to watch being obsessed with the beach, wanting Barbie and him to be more than friends, and discovering things men do in the real world and bringing this stuff to Barbieland; tagging along with Barbie on her journey to the real-world helping Barbie with her problem while also learning new things himself.The rest of the cast of the movie are playing a bunch of diverse kinds of Barbies and Kens involving Weird Barbie played by Kate McKinnon, and there being one Allan played by Michael Cera who is also funny with the rest of the cast that involves how Barbieland works and how their characters interact off each other. The movie has a fictional version of the toy company Mattel with Will Ferrell as the Mattel CEO who is funny, but sometimes some of the scenes at Mattel in the movie were not that funny, even though the way they make fun of Mattel can be funny to watch. There is no real antagonist for this movie, unless you want to count Mattel in the movie, but they are not in the movie as much as they could be, so it focuses on Barbie's self-journey on her existence and how the world works.The world of Barbieland does look amazing with the Barbies having dream houses that look like the toy sets with plastic props and sound effects that makes it look like the Barbies are doing things in their lives, and them occasionally moving around like they are being played with. Everything in Barbieland looks like life sized versions of the toys with water being plastic and the vehicles moving like toy cars, I especially like how Barbieland is connected to the real world as explained by Helen Mirren as the Narrator in the beginning of the movie. Plus, I like how they talk about how the Barbie doll in the real world affects the real Barbies in Barbieland, while also talking about the discontinued/cancelled Barbies and Kens in both worlds.The movie Barbie (2023) was funny, weird, creative, emotionally investing at times, and entertaining/fun to watch; the acting from the whole cast is great, Barbieland looks great, the songs in the movie are catchy, and there is a good message in the movie going around involving Barbie thinking Barbies changed things in the real world with equal rights and stuff like that. An issue would be that it puts its message in your face too much at certain points, but by the second and third act the movie goes a different direction than what I was expecting, and I was laughing a lot. People who love the Barbie toys will like this movie, people who are in the middle with Barbie like me will like it, and the people who do not like the Barbie toys might get some enjoyment out of this film because the movie says both good and not good things about the toys making fun of them which makes this movie entertaining to watch.",a barbi world,anoth movi base famou toy base barbi doll toy compani mattel i love barbi toy i hate either the movi barbi surprisingli good funni good messag interest premis movi great cast margot robbi barbi ryan gosl ken anoth draw movi premis cast design look movi look like barbi playset look barbieland amount pink use life plastic prop use like barbi toy setsi could think anyon el play role main barbi margot robbi great role barbi existenti crisi chang like foot flat ground instead tippi toe funni likabl tri find human play doll real world ryan gosl ken funni watch ob beach want barbi friend discov thing men real world bring stuff barbieland tag along barbi journey realworld help barbi problem also learn new thing himselfth rest cast movi play bunch diver kind barbi ken involv weird barbi play kate mckinnon one allan play michael cera also funni rest cast involv barbieland work charact interact the movi fiction version toy compani mattel will ferrel mattel ceo funni sometim scene mattel movi funni even though way make fun mattel funni watch there real antagonist movi unless want count mattel movi movi much could focus barbi selfjourney exist world worksth world barbieland look amaz barbi dream hous look like toy set plastic prop sound effect make look like barbi thing live occasion move around like play everyth barbieland look like life size version toy water plastic vehicl move like toy car i especi like barbieland connect real world explain helen mirren narrat begin movi plu i like talk barbi doll real world affect real barbi barbieland also talk discontinuedcancel barbi ken worldsth movi barbi funni weird creativ emot invest time entertainingfun watch act whole cast great barbieland look great song movi catchi good messag movi go around involv barbi think barbi chang thing real world equal right stuff like an issu would put messag face much certain point second third act movi goe differ direct i expect i laugh lot peopl love barbi toy like movi peopl middl barbi like like peopl like barbi toy might get enjoy film movi say good good thing toy make fun make movi entertain watch
Barbie is as toxic as the plastic it's made from,"Barbie is a movie that tries to be clever, funny, and empowering, but fails miserably at all three. It is a self-indulgent, overlong, and unfunny mess that wastes the talents of its cast and crew. The movie is based on the popular doll line, but instead of celebrating the diversity and creativity of Barbie, it mocks and ridicules her. The plot is thin and nonsensical, the jokes are stale and offensive, and the characters are shallow and annoying. The movie is full of meta humor and references, but they are neither smart nor original. They are just a way for the filmmakers to show off their supposed wit and knowledge, while insulting the audience's intelligence and taste.The movie stars Margot Robbie as Barbie, a perfect doll who lives in a perfect world called Barbieland. She is happy and popular, until she realizes that she doesn't fit in with the other Barbies, who are all stereotypes and clichés. She decides to go to the real world to find her true purpose, dragging along her boyfriend Ken (Ryan Gosling), who is a spineless and needy accessory. In the real world, they encounter various challenges and adventures, such as meeting Gloria (America Ferrera), a feminist activist who teaches Barbie about empowerment, and Kate McKinnon's character, a cynical comedian who mocks Barbie's naïveté and optimism. Along the way, they also meet other versions of Barbie (played by Issa Rae, Rhea Perlman, and others), who are supposed to represent the diversity and evolution of the doll, but are actually just caricatures and stereotypes.The movie is directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig, who has made some excellent films in the past, such as Lady Bird and Little Women. However, in this movie, she seems to have lost her touch and vision. She tries to make a movie that is both a satire and a tribute to Barbie, but ends up making a movie that is neither. She fails to balance the tone and the message of the movie, which is confused and contradictory. She also fails to make the movie entertaining and engaging, which is the most basic requirement of a comedy. The movie is boring and tedious, with scenes that drag on and on, and jokes that fall flat and cringe-worthy. The movie is also visually unappealing, with a garish and artificial color palette, and a cheap and cartoonish CGI.The movie is also a waste of the talent and charisma of its cast, who are all capable of much better performances. Margot Robbie is a talented and versatile actress, but in this movie, she is reduced to a bland and annoying protagonist, who is neither funny nor sympathetic. She tries to make Barbie a complex and relatable character, but ends up making her a shallow and irritating one. Ryan Gosling is a charming and handsome actor, but in this movie, he is reduced to a dull and pathetic sidekick, who is neither amusing nor supportive. He tries to make Ken a loyal and loving partner, but ends up making him a clingy and dependent one.

Surprisingly memorable,"I entered the cinema with high expectations, and they were massively outdone. The movie unfolds in a humorous manner, as lovable characters evolve in the most beautiful way they could. Margot Robbie is truly outstanding, and as a spectator I fully lived the experience thanks to her incontestable talent. As the experiences slowly unwrap, the issues and feelings that are contoured cut deeper and deeper, and the audience gets to experience these emotions in a sincere, beautiful way.The movie is about the simplicity and complexity of life, about humans and their emotions, about what we do and why we do it, and about how they all meet in a fulfilling and imperfectly beautiful point.",surprisingli memor,i enter cinema high expect massiv outdon the movi unfold humor manner lovabl charact evolv beauti way could margot robbi truli outstand spectat i fulli live experi thank incontest talent a experi slowli unwrap issu feel contour cut deeper deeper audienc get experi emot sincer beauti wayth movi simplic complex life human emot meet fulfil imperfectli beauti point
Replace the big names with people with simialr acting chops.......will people still watch and praise this??,"This movie had top notch marketing. So good that I went to see it although I had doubt about whether it will be actually good. At the end I did not like it that much.Nothing can be said about the quality of acting to be honest. The actors did a tremendous job across the board. Margot was superb. A few of the supporting actors were also great. Gosling's portrayal of Ken was hilarious.I'm no expert in movie making but to me the set design, costume design overall making of the movie looked very good but the beef I have is with the story. To me it didn't felt good enough. It was weird to say the least. I know asking for logic is too much in this particular world but there should be some for it to be enjoyable. The events that took place in the real world was ridiculous to say the least.I was just thinking if all the big names were replaced with new actors who lets just say acted at the same level of the big names, would people even watch this and talk this highly about it?

Exceeded my high expectations,"I bought into the marketing hype and boy did this movie deliver! It was smart, funny, charismatic, visually pleasing and touching!It was both a perfect social commentary on the world today from a place of empathy and understanding for both men and women. From some haters online I thought it was going to be overly feminist (which I have no problem with) but I think it perfectly expressed how patriarchy is detrimental for men as well as women.But more importantly it was hilarious. Kate McKinnon stole the show, but the acting was solid all around. Really excited to see what Greta Gerwig does next-I heard this movie just surpassed $1Billion-the results speak for themselves.",exceed high expect,i bought market hype boy movi deliv it smart funni charismat visual plea touchingit perfect social commentari world today place empathi understand men woman from hater onlin i thought go overli feminist i problem i think perfectli express patriarchi detriment men well womenbut importantli hilari kate mckinnon stole show act solid around realli excit see greta gerwig nexti heard movi surpass billionth result speak
Pink Rose of Cairo,"The absolute best thing about this movie, is that it drives *exactly* the right people up a wall. In truth, it is neither as frivolous as it outwardly appears, nor nearly as socially progressive as it wants to be. And it's certainly not as clever as it thinks it is. Supporting characters played by Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell are basic, and frankly unnecessary. As for the humor, only a few lines land. ""I'm a man without power, does that make me a woman?"" was one of the few. The 2001 opening was cute. The railway joke I'd seen on social media, and thought that was good, but in the film it just felt like they were trying a little *too* hard to be clever. I appreciate it, but I just don't feel they committed enough to that tack.On the plus side, there's never going to be a time when watching Margot Robbie is going to be a chore. She is wonderfully charming, and does a great job making the character and film work as much as it does. America Ferrera also does a great job, and has the only real scene of strident messaging to bother (those people who try hard to be bothered by such things). But, that is the point-of-view of the film, and what the filmmakers wants to portray. More power to them.As for the ""plot' such as it is, it's really just another fish-out-of-water, or even, body-switch trope, with the added metaphysical dimension of reality vs. Fantasy. Which is what put me in mind of Purple Rose of Cairo. A film with a broader, less directed, female empowerment message, but a similar contrast of harsh reality and idealized fantasy.

Margot Robbie Is Barbie,"This is a fun, clever film that does about as much with its premise as it possibly could. Margot Robbie is cast as a doll with a reputation for an unrealistic body type. Finding a way to make a doll not only human but relatable and compelling enough to anchor a feature film is a daunting challenge, but somehow Robbie does just that while also managing to look the part. Appropriately, the art direction is playful. For all the inventiveness of this film, its concept occasionally leaves its screenplay unfocused.In her live-action, big-screen debut, Barbie suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence.",margot robbi is barbi,thi fun clever film much premis possibl could margot robbi cast doll reput unrealist bodi type find way make doll human relat compel enough anchor featur film daunt challeng somehow robbi also manag look part appropri art direct play for invent film concept occasion leav screenplay unfocusedin liveact bigscreen debut barbi suffer crisi lead question world exist
Sometimes it's hard to be a woman.,"As I have a strong antipathy toward films based on toys and video games, I wasn't sure I'd see BARBIE. However, I had a free evening and, I'll admit, all the hoopla made me curious. So I kicked off my vacation with a visit to my local theater.I thought about 80% of BARBIE was very well done. Among its strong points:Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, each of whom turned in a dazzling performance;Rhea Perlman, Kate McKinnon, and Will Ferrell were also very good, along with Helen Mirren as the sardonic narrator;The script was loaded with razor-sharp one-liners;The film's depiction of Barbieland was magnificent;The slapstick touches were hilarious;Its utter savaging of Mattell (and corporate culture in general). Clearly, the company has a sense of humor!Here's what I could have done without:Great Gerwig's monologues, which I find as wearing as Oliver Stone's;The ending was too drawn out, in particular the final scene between Margot Robbie and Rhea Perlman.I can see BARBIE garnering several Oscar nominations (if not always wins).

Nice Flick and it wont challenge your manhood,"It wasn't bad at all; it's funny and certainly worth watching. Margot Robbie delivers a brilliant performance and perfectly embodies the character, bringing the iconic toy to life.Barbie, as a doll and figure, became immensely popular and essentially replaced the term 'doll' itself. In the past, any such toy was simply referred to as Barbie.The movie explores how these figures became companions to many, more than just toys. It showcases an alternate world of Barbie in a joyful and beautiful manner.It's a good movie with plenty of laughs and overall enjoyment.

The Most Moving Film I've Ever Seen,"I'm not even joking when I say this was the most moving film I've ever seen. Going into this I expected the outcome to be one of two things: either is was going to be very dumb and bad, or it would be absolutely amazing. No in between. And now, I can confidently say that it was absolutely amazing. It made me laugh, it made me tear up, it made me feel so much more than I ever could have expected a movie about Barbies, or any toys in general, to make me feel. I genuinely believe that it is going to be one of the most influential movies of this generation.Before I get into why specifically I loved it so much, I would like to first say that to the men out there that are calling this movie ""man-hating,"" you could not be more wrong. If you think that, then clearly you went in with your own preconceived notions and did not pay enough attention to the message of the movie. I also am a man and this movie delivered a beautifully written feminist message that depicted unfair societal stereotypes placed onto women and proved the reasons why the patriarchy is truly a bad thing. Just because it did that, does not make it man-hating, especially since it also depicted and drew awareness to negative societal pressure placed onto men and their emotions.Now, onto why I really loved this movie. First off, it was very funny and light hearted at exactly the right points. I liked that it left room for dramatic scenes that could really tug at the heart strings and Margot Robbie in particular delivered a very powerful performance. Yes, she had great comedic timing, but her talent really showed in more emotional scenes where Barbie felt she had to still act like her happy smiley self despite the overwhelming sadness she was feeling. Not only that, but the costumes and sets were immaculate. It was not only well written and acted, but clearly a lot of care went into the movie from the crew. Each character, even despite their limited screen time, was fleshed out and everyone did a great job making their characters unique and different from each other.This movie made me think so much. I had to let it fester in my brain for a few days before writing a review because I had so many thoughts. I know many people wished it was more light hearted at times, but I am so glad it wasn't, because if it was, it never could have been as powerful and emotional for me. The writers and directors could have taken a more silly, childish approach, but instead they decided upon a story that could make the world a better place, and I have to commend that.Overall, the Barbie Movie was so much more than I ever could have expected it to be and I urge anyone who hasn't yet to go watch it, especially if you have an open mind and, most importantly, an open heart. As of right now, my rating is a 9/10, but I definitely think it will increase once I inevitably watch it again. I think this movie has the potential to do a lot of good for the world.",the most move film ive ever seen,im even joke i say move film ive ever seen go i expect outcom one two thing either go dumb bad would absolut amaz no and i confid say absolut amaz it made laugh made tear made feel much i ever could expect movi barbi toy gener make feel i genuin believ go one influenti movi generationbefor i get specif i love much i would like first say men call movi manhat could wrong if think clearli went preconceiv notion pay enough attent messag movi i also man movi deliv beauti written feminist messag depict unfair societ stereotyp place onto woman prove reason patriarchi truli bad thing just make manhat especi sinc also depict drew awar neg societ pressur place onto men emotionsnow onto i realli love movi first funni light heart exactli right point i like left room dramat scene could realli tug heart string margot robbi particular deliv power perform ye great comed time talent realli show emot scene barbi felt still act like happi smiley self despit overwhelm sad feel not costum set immacul it well written act clearli lot care went movi crew each charact even despit limit screen time flesh everyon great job make charact uniqu differ otherthi movi made think much i let fester brain day write review i mani thought i know mani peopl wish light heart time i glad wasnt never could power emot the writer director could taken silli childish approach instead decid upon stori could make world better place i commend thatoveral barbi movi much i ever could expect i urg anyon hasnt yet go watch especi open mind importantli open heart a right rate i definit think increas i inevit watch i think movi potenti lot good world

Barbie - A Spectacular Failure,"""Barbie"" - a movie that promised so much but delivered so little. I can't believe a film with such a beloved character could turn out to be this boring and devoid of any intelligence. It's simply a horrible cinematic experience, and I can't stress enough how much you won't miss if you choose to skip it. In fact, I'd go as far as saying that staring at a blank wall for two hours would be a more efficient use of your time.This movie isn't just a disappointment; it's a disaster on multiple levels. It fails to cater to any age group - not for kids, not for teenagers, and certainly not for adults. It left me with the same feeling of disillusionment as ""Matrix 4"" and the final part of ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them."" It's baffling to see what's happening in the American film industry lately. Writers, producers, and directors seem to have lost touch with what makes a great movie, consistently churning out films that do nothing but disappoint.In the case of ""Barbie,"" it's a classic example of how a beloved character can be mishandled on the big screen. Instead of bringing the magic of Barbie to life, this film manages to strip away everything that makes her special. Save yourself from this cinematic travesty and explore the countless other films that will truly entertain and delight.

From Mattel She Came...And Now She Has Conquered,"Where to begin?If anyone had told you at the start of 2023 that the highest-grossing film of the year was going to be a film based on a female doll that first appeared in 1959, you'd probably have them trucked off to the funny farm. And yet that is what has happened with BARBIE. Somehow, perhaps through osmosis, Gerta Gerwig, one of Hollywood's great female directors of this age, known for films like 2017's LADY BIRD and 2019's LITTLE WOMEN (a great adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's literary masterpiece), has made the world's most famous doll become a huge deal, through a mix of goofiness, gaudiness, a certain amount of camp, satire, and pointed jabs at society.Mrs. Gerwig has also managed to do so with a few references to films of the distant and not so distant past. Take the very opening scene, in which little girls of a previous ""era"" used to play with baby dolls, giving them the idea that the only ideal for a woman to be when she grew up was to be merely a mother. But then Barbie comes along, and inspires them to destroy the past to create a better future. Gerwig does this in clear but witty homage to the ""Dawn Of Man"" sequence that opens up director Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, with Barbie standing in for the monolith, and the awestruck little girls standing in for the man-apes. Gerwig even went to the trouble to use both the portentous opening of Richard Strauss' ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" and the Kyrie from Gyorgy Ligeti's ""Requiem"" from Kubrick's film (getting the hearty approval of Kubrick's family in the process).After that, BARBIE goes into the adventures, and misadventures, of the world's most famous doll, in the personage of Margot Robbie (as the so-called ""stereotypical"" Barbie), and Ryan Gosling (LA LA LAND; FIRST MAN) as the original Ken. Robbie's existence with the other Barbies throughout time in Barbieland (which looks like a crazy amalgam of Hollywood, Venice, LAX, and Palm Springs rolled into one), finds her making her way into the Real World of today, and finding out, much to her shock, that being the ideal of perfection not only isn't all that it's cracked up to be, but that male patriarchy is the essence of everything in that world. In the meantime, Gosling's Ken, through reading about male patriarchy in high school books, leads a revolt with the ""other"" Kens to turn Barbieworld into ""Ken's World"", a symbol of male testosterone excess. The end result is crazy chaos, involving not only Mattel's CEO (Will Farrell), but also a mother (America Ferrera) and her daughter (Sascha Greenblatt), and Ruth Handler (Rhea Perlman), the actual woman responsible for having created the original Barbie.With all these crazy things happening in the span of just under two hours, it is not surprising that some of the acting is rather overripe, and the jokes and sight gags don't always work. But given all this, and the fact that it sometimes seems on the verge of falling totally apart, the film stays on track due to Mrs. Gerwig's imaginative direction, and, most especially, Robbie's performance as Barbie, where she evolves from a stereotypical figure to a genuinely human one If some of the shots Mrs. Gerwig and her co-screenwriter Noah Bumbach take on the clichés of the status of men and women in the real world can sometimes border on blatant point-making, many of the others are so spot-on that one cannot help laughing at them once we get them.Gerwig's film references, besides the aforementioned ""2001"" homage, include two more Kubrick classics (DOCTOR STRANGELOVE; THE SHINING), plus THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG, THE WIZARD OF OZ, GREASE, and SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, to name just a few. In the end, however, BARBIE is a totally original and insane piece of both old and new Hollywood at its best. For this, Gerwig, Robbie, and Gosling, along with the droll narration of Dame Helen Mirren, deserve tons of credit, as they managed to make what could easily have been an unmitigated disaster into a memorable and wholly unexpected smash spectacle.BARBIE gets a '9' rating from me.",from mattel she cameand now she ha conquer,where beginif anyon told start highestgross film year go film base femal doll first appear youd probabl truck funni farm and yet happen barbi somehow perhap osmosi gerta gerwig one hollywood great femal director age known film like ladi bird littl woman great adapt louisa may alcott literari masterpiec made world famou doll becom huge deal mix goofi gaudi certain amount camp satir point jab societymr gerwig also manag refer film distant distant past take open scene littl girl previou era use play babi doll give idea ideal woman grew mere mother but barbi come along inspir destroy past creat better futur gerwig clear witti homag dawn of man sequenc open director stanley kubrick scifi masterpiec a space odyssey barbi stand monolith awestruck littl girl stand manap gerwig even went troubl use portent open richard strauss also sprach zarathustra kyri gyorgi ligeti requiem kubrick film get hearti approv kubrick famili processaft barbi goe adventur misadventur world famou doll personag margot robbi socal stereotyp barbi ryan gosl la la land first man origin ken robbi exist barbi throughout time barbieland look like crazi amalgam hollywood venic lax palm spring roll one find make way real world today find much shock ideal perfect isnt crack male patriarchi essenc everyth world in meantim gosl ken read male patriarchi high school book lead revolt ken turn barbieworld ken world symbol male testosteron excess the end result crazi chao involv mattel ceo will farrel also mother america ferrera daughter sascha greenblatt ruth handler rhea perlman actual woman respons creat origin barbiewith crazi thing happen span two hour surpris act rather overrip joke sight gag dont alway work but given fact sometim seem verg fall total apart film stay track due mr gerwig imagin direct especi robbi perform barbi evolv stereotyp figur genuin human one if shot mr gerwig coscreenwrit noah bumbach take clich statu men woman real world sometim border blatant pointmak mani other spoton one help laugh get themgerwig film refer besid aforement homag includ two kubrick classic doctor strangelov the shine plu the umbrella of cherbourg the wizard of oz greas saturday night fever name in end howev barbi total origin insan piec old new hollywood best for gerwig robbi gosl along droll narrat dame helen mirren deserv ton credit manag make could easili unmitig disast memor wholli unexpect smash spectaclebarbi get rate
Barbie is awesome,"Let's just get it out of the way, I freaking love Barbie. So many memories and ideals are connected to her that even without the movie I still get nostalgic about. The iconography, the looks, Ken (~swoon~)... there was one problem though, I am a boy, I could never get a Barbie because my parents never would let me have one. Instead I stole my cousins mermaid Barbie and treated her like one of my most precious toys until she disappeared, perhaps she went into Barbieland? Greta Gerwig's movie seemingly let us tap into all of that and more thanks to a great PR team that I haven't seen work their magic since a long long time, in other words hype has been BUILT. How does it fare? I left the cinema with a smile but I wish that it could have something MORE. Let me explain down below.Barbie is a movie that is about Barbie, the doll, the idea, living in a world separate from reality called Barbieland a world where Barbie is everything, from the president to a Nobel prize laureate to a doctor. She runs this world in all her iterations, until the stereotypical Barbie somehow gets thoughts about death, she gets a flat foot (CHAOS!) and she gets cellulites (THE HORROR!)- she has to fix this by travelling in the real world with Ken and in this she meets a hard working mother and her cynical daughter- fun hijinks galore!This movie has got the aesthetics DOWN, like it's so pretty and so meticulously done with all the details, to how the actors act and how the worlds are built- this is more on how the Barbie world is, because when it mixes with the real world. That's where things get a bit complicated.Example; There's no actual ""real"" separation between Barbieland or the real world, meaning that the real world feels like a mirror flipped version of Barbieland where people act just as outlandish as the titular dolls. I kinda wish that Greta would've made a script that actually puts Barbie in real world, how it is right now, and I know that Greta is great at making reality feel relatable and recognisable and human but I felt there was not much of a difference. Maybe it was so that they could fill the whole Mattel-company storyline in it? Either way I wish that Greta would play more with these contrasts and fish-out-of-water-feelings.This in turn makes the other characters that should be relatable for the moviegoers- i.e. The daughter and the mother feel painfully flat and just unnecessary for the story overall, despite making them ""deep"" they felt honestly super flat, like dolls and stereotypes of characters in a movie. And I don't think that was Greta's intention, not if you see the movies that she's done before where there's always a singular perspective but here I think she's kind of confused on who to use the perspective the most on. Luckily it is Barbie and Ken for the most of the movie, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are doing a fantastic job at playing these characters and it's in their moments where the comedy shines the most.Another missed opportunity generally I think is just addressing the gay history that is tied to the Barbie brand. And how gay men like me were influenced by it- not to say that this was absolutely important for a movie like this but I still feel like it would've made sense, at least the gay doll of 90s Ken (who was made popular in the 90s due to being bought by mostly gay men) made an appearance, if only briefly. I know, I shouldn't make demands about this but I feel like there would've been something even more interesting with addressing all the boys that play with Barbie dolls, the ""real world"" feels very black and white in this sense. But I regress, this is just a tangent and a thought!I love the comedic and camp elements, I think they are what sustain the movie and the fashion of course. Also I love that it brings forth the themes of feminism as that is needed in a movie like this, I think that it does so in a great manner. Is it the movie that I wanted?

funny with social commentary,"Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives in Barbieland. Ken (Ryan Gosling) is always desperate for her attention. All the Ken and Barbie dolls live in a happy matriarchy unaware of the real world. Out of the blue, Barbie starts pondering death and her existence. Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) tells her that she has opened a portal to the real world and must fix whatever is her real world problem before she can return to her perfect self. She and stowaway Ken find the real world completely different than their expectations. Mattel CEO (Will Ferrell) insists on putting her back in the box. Mattel secretary Gloria (America Ferrera) had caused the problem by drawing new forms of Barbie.First, I love the premise and I love the 2001 opening. The start is a lot funnier than I expected. Margot Robbie is great and Ryan Gosling is hilarious. It's a great start in Barbieland. The first moments in LA is a little too much. Quite frankly, Barbie and Ken would not stand out at Venice beach. The male leering is good enough. They don't need to do the stereotype abusive guys. The real world should be realistic. Barbie and Ken would be better fishes out of the water in a recognizable regular world. The more average the real world is, the better it is for the characters to showcase their outrageousness.Mattel is fun and I like the ridiculous silliness. Will Ferrell is a good way to show their outrageous quality. The movie has a lot of social commentary and that aspect does threaten to overwhelm it. The last act has some wonky moments as the movie tries to wrap its arms around the heavier social discussions. I would like to keep that more contained and concentrate on the mother daughter relationships. It's Gloria and Sasha, but it's also Ruth and Barbara. That's a perfect way to end the movie. I do like the montage idea, but I didn't realize what it was doing initially. It would have been fine to do that for the closing credits. All in all, this is a funny engaging movie and it's able to deal with some of the tougher social material.",funni social commentari,barbi margot robbi live barbieland ken ryan gosl alway desper attent all ken barbi doll live happi matriarchi unawar real world out blue barbi start ponder death exist weird barbi kate mckinnon tell open portal real world must fix whatev real world problem return perfect self she stowaway ken find real world complet differ expect mattel ceo will ferrel insist put back box mattel secretari gloria america ferrera caus problem draw new form barbiefirst i love premis i love open the start lot funnier i expect margot robbi great ryan gosl hilari it great start barbieland the first moment la littl much quit frankli barbi ken would stand venic beach the male leer good enough they dont need stereotyp abus guy the real world realist barbi ken would better fish water recogniz regular world the averag real world better charact showcas outrageousnessmattel fun i like ridicul silli will ferrel good way show outrag qualiti the movi lot social commentari aspect threaten overwhelm the last act wonki moment movi tri wrap arm around heavier social discus i would like keep contain concentr mother daughter relationship it gloria sasha also ruth barbara that perfect way end movi i like montag idea i didnt realiz initi it would fine close credit all funni engag movi abl deal tougher social materi
"I didn't get what I came here to see, but I still had a blast the whole way through. 7.5/10","Barbie sets herself to go to the real world to solve her flat feet and cellulite by connecting with the girl that played with her.Entering Barbieland is breathtaking. It's built exactly like a child's imagination with incredible set designs and quirky mechanics. The first thirty minutes are fun and filled with music and bright colours. The dance sequences brings me back to my childhood where I would create these kinds of scenes with my toys. I wish we could have stayed in this wonderland a bit longer before we had to get to the real world.Ryan Gossling stole the show. I don't remember the last time I laughed so much. It was iconic how Gerwig reversed the narrative and made Ken into the typical representation of women in film. The film is so clever and is clearly made by someone that is a student of film. With references of Space Odessey, the Matrix, The Truman Show, The Wizard of Oz, and hundreds of others, it made the film have that much more depth.I feel like the plot could have been rearranged a bit. The quests Barbie is supposed to solve seems irrelevant to me. It offers comic relief, but I believe it would have been more pertinent to have her explore the real world to see how Barbies ""saved"" us. The mom and daughter character are useless to the narrative. Other than having 0 personality or depth, we never got to understand their tension or learn their drives. They could have been better written, or removed all together. The monologue sequence was a mistake. Show me how women live in this world instead of telling me. It sounded too preachy for me, despite me being a feminist. If we would have spent less time on the mother and daughter, and more on giving concrete examples of women's pressure, it would have been a stronger film.The story and characterization is also lacking at Mattel. We never get a conclusion to why Mattel went back to Barbieland. The story felt incomplete, and perhaps overly cut due to corporate producers. This brings me to argue that we didn't receive the movie that was intended by the director. Although it being a critique on our society and the impossible standards for women, it could have been pushed even further. Perhaps the large presence of corporate players like Mattel and Chevrolet hindered the extent of the satire. I was expecting a Kubrick kind of satire, and as much as we did get some of that, more subtle satire could have been beneficial. I have full confidence in Gerwig's skills which is why I'd be curious to see a directors cut. Let's petition for it!The ending was also disappointing for me. I felt like I was watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 for no apparent reason. Perhaps they didn't really know where to go with the story and I'm shocked they chose that. I liked that we got to meet the creator of Barbie, but there was something missing for me. Overall, this was a fun time. I think most audiences will enjoy this despite having some plot holes. I look forward to watching it again in the future.",i didnt get i came see i still blast whole way,barbi set go real world solv flat foot cellulit connect girl play herent barbieland breathtak it built exactli like child imagin incred set design quirki mechan the first thirti minut fun fill music bright colour the danc sequenc bring back childhood i would creat kind scene toy i wish could stay wonderland bit longer get real worldryan gossl stole show i dont rememb last time i laugh much it icon gerwig revers narr made ken typic represent woman film the film clever clearli made someon student film with refer space odessey matrix the truman show the wizard oz hundr other made film much depthi feel like plot could rearrang bit the quest barbi suppos solv seem irrelev it offer comic relief i believ would pertin explor real world see barbi save u the mom daughter charact useless narr other person depth never got understand tension learn drive they could better written remov togeth the monologu sequenc mistak show woman live world instead tell it sound preachi despit feminist if would spent le time mother daughter give concret exampl woman pressur would stronger filmth stori character also lack mattel we never get conclus mattel went back barbieland the stori felt incomplet perhap overli cut due corpor produc thi bring argu didnt receiv movi intend director although critiqu societi imposs standard woman could push even perhap larg presenc corpor player like mattel chevrolet hinder extent satir i expect kubrick kind satir much get subtl satir could benefici i full confid gerwig skill id curiou see director cut let petit itth end also disappoint i felt like i watch harri potter deathli hallow part appar reason perhap didnt realli know go stori im shock chose i like got meet creator barbi someth miss overal fun time i think audienc enjoy despit plot hole i look forward watch futur
Enchantment w/ genuine emotion,"I absolutely loved it. Margot Robbie is the perfect stereotypical Barbie. Ryan Gosling gives an Oscar-worthy performance and has a true rock 'n' roll voice. The soundtrack is also very, very good. Subjects of patriarchy and cultural hegemony are approached with humour and historical references. Michael Cera is funnily adorable. Barbie is funny and surprisingly entertaining. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach wrote an enchanting script with genuine emotion. Barbie was brilliantly cast. I loved Ryan Gosling. He's terrific as Ken and delivers an Oscar-worthy performance.

She's Everything. He's Just Ken.,"Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" is a stunning piece of cinema when it comes to costume and set design which blew me away with. Also had good songs and catchy musical numbers but was not as good as expected. With a film being called ""Barbie"" Margot Robbie was great as usual, but Ryan Gosling's Ken was the one who absolutely stole the show with it being his funniest role to date. Now the first 10-15 minutes were rough to get through for myself with the introduction to Barbie world, which is understandable considering what it is. But then even leading into the ""Real-World"" part of the film some of it still had the cheesy bits that I didn't like. From that point on though I did end up enjoying most of the film and the performances from everyone on screen. Overall, the good moments outweigh the bad ones and it ending up being a good fun/comedy film.",she everyth he just ken,greta gerwig barbi stun piec cinema come costum set design blew away also good song catchi music number good expect with film call barbi margot robbi great usual ryan gosl ken one absolut stole show funniest role date now first minut rough get introduct barbi world understand consid but even lead realworld part film still cheesi bit i didnt like from point though i end enjoy film perform everyon screen overal good moment outweigh bad one end good funcomedi film
"Preachy, vapid, and disappointing","I went in with my sister who grew up watching animated Barbie movies since she was a kid like ""Barbie: Princess Charm School"" or ""Barbie: Princess and the Popstar"" or ""Barbie: Rapunzel,"" etc. I was excited, but more for her, because I know how much Barbie means to her. But sadly, she and I were very disappointed.Like to my sister, Barbie means something to girls everywhere, teaching the important and necessary values aimed at women, and giving them a role model to look up to. But after seeing this movie I can't tell you what Barbie stands for.In ""Barbie"" Margot Robbie's character is called a ""fascist"" and a terribly unrealistic image of a perfect woman. Ken is emasculated, fed sexist stereotypes and turned into a joke. The rest of the other Barbies are manipulative and standard feminist archetypes.I'm not political, but there's an obvious message the writers are pushing here. And it's not subtle at all. Men are worthless and Barbie's unique femininity is problematic.The best thing about the film is its wonderful costume design and special effects. But sadly, that's about it for ""Barbie.""",preachi vapid disappoint,i went sister grew watch anim barbi movi sinc kid like barbi princess charm school barbi princess popstar barbi rapunzel etc i excit i know much barbi mean but sadli i disappointedlik sister barbi mean someth girl everywher teach import necessari valu aim woman give role model look but see movi i cant tell barbi stand forin barbi margot robbi charact call fascist terribl unrealist imag perfect woman ken emascul fed sexist stereotyp turn joke the rest barbi manipul standard feminist archetypesim polit there obviou messag writer push and subtl men worthless barbi uniqu feminin problematicth best thing film wonder costum design special effect but sadli that barbi

What is Barbie?,"Was I expecting more from Greta gerwig? Yes!Form the trailers, i never got a solid idea what Barbie the film was: a musical, a comedy, a coming of age story, a metaphor for something greater ? Maybe Barbie tries all of the above to a shallow extend. There are deep ideas introduced that immediately caught my attention. Several in fact, scattered strategically at the beginning, middle, and close to the end. The thing is that those ideas are never fully developed and some even forgotten. The film's comedy is delivered in pastels, pink jokes that rarely made me laugh.Strangely, the film aesthetic, which is pastels, is not quite fully realized either: or pushed to its full vibrancy like in a WES ANDERSON film. The jokes are bland neither too sophisticated for adults to get them, or charmingly innocent for kids to enjoy them.Margo does a good job as Barbie, but is good good enough for a leading role where the fantasy was being sold to me? Honestly, I never actually believed it. Margo never looks like Barbie herself , aside the colors and the imposed name. She did what she could, but I never got the fantasy of Barbie. I believed Reese whiterspoon in legally blonde to be more Barbie like than Margo Robbie herself.The film has great refreshing moments like America ferrera's scenes , full of vigorous lines and life. Also, Ryan gosling gives an excellent portrayal of a ken with an existential crisis. The ending dancing number: fun and amazing. That number alone could potentially go for award nominations.Would I recommend the film to fans of Barbie, yes. Would I personally sit through to watch it again, no.All and all, I walked away the theater not knowing for sure what Barbie the movie was. It is the weakest project artistically speaking from Greta gerwig. In Barbie, Greta's magic and quirky comedic take on life is muddle among so many different things thrown together; it looses the comedy of Frances ha, and the driving force of nature that is lady bird.",what barbi,wa i expect greta gerwig yesform trailer never got solid idea barbi film music comedi come age stori metaphor someth greater mayb barbi tri shallow extend there deep idea introduc immedi caught attent sever fact scatter strateg begin middl close end the thing idea never fulli develop even forgotten the film comedi deliv pastel pink joke rare made laughstrang film aesthet pastel quit fulli realiz either push full vibranc like we anderson film the joke bland neither sophist adult get charmingli innoc kid enjoy themmargo good job barbi good good enough lead role fantasi sold honestli i never actual believ margo never look like barbi asid color impos name she could i never got fantasi barbi i believ rees whiterspoon legal blond barbi like margo robbi herselfth film great refresh moment like america ferrera scene full vigor line life also ryan gosl give excel portray ken existenti crisi the end danc number fun amaz that number alon could potenti go award nominationswould i recommend film fan barbi ye would i person sit watch noall i walk away theater know sure barbi movi it weakest project artist speak greta gerwig in barbi greta magic quirki comed take life muddl among mani differ thing thrown togeth loo comedi franc ha drive forc natur ladi bird
"""The Matrix"" re imagined in pink and neon... it doesn't work","I saw this film with an open mind. I was ready for it to be enjoyable in some sort of way, either visually, through the actors, perhaps a fun story, or just turning off the brain and seeing what they came up with. Unfortunately, it struck out on all accounts. The much hyped visual experience and world building got old fast. The actors were so clichéd and pigeonholed that they were hard to watch (as you may have heard, Ryan Gosling is the star and most interesting character despite the movie name). The movie was not fun after the first 15 minutes. In fact, it was intentionally written to be painful and to express the writer/director's personal concerns. We were supposed to be frustrated but were not rewarded with any payoff at the end.Most concerning is that Barbie was clearly modeled after the first Matrix movie but in all the worst ways. Barbie's world is a binary place composed of Barbieland, where the embodiments of the toys live and what they call ""The Real World"". The Real World is name of the place they travel to in Matrix as well but, in Barbie, it's not a dark hellish landscape run by machines. Instead, it resembles our actual real world in appearance but it seems to be run by the evil toy company Mattel. Also, the men are all shown to be domineering, rude, and chauvinistic. It's clearly supposed to represent our real world but goes so far into fantasy that it's as unrealistic as the one in The Matrix. A man walking by Barbie sexually harasses her and slaps her on the backside. She then gets arrested for defending herself (what??). While shes being arrested, the male officers comment on her body and sexually harass her more. The toy company executives all wear suits like the Agents in The Matrix and work in unrealistic barren, industrial looking cubicles. They also drive black SUVs around with no regard for law and order as though they are in charge of the world. We get many heavy handed speeches about how badly women are treated in The Real World and I lost count of the number of times the word ""patriarchy"" was used. I know the director wanted to express her thoughts about western society but it was such a dystopian, bleak world that it was impossible to compare it to our world. In The Matrix, there was depth and nuance to both worlds but in Barbie there was mostly sadness in both. The movie shows a fake world dominated by women in the beginning, then a fake world dominated by men as it progresses, and completes by showing us that the two are completely incompatible. The bright, colorful, happy movie we were shown in the promotional material is actually dark, depressing, and irredeemable. If it was meant to reflect our real world, well, it's so far out there that it doesn't even come close. If its mean to show a fantasy world, the fantasy is that there is incompatibility and depression between the sexes with no solution available. It was difficult to complete watching Barbie because it tried to say so much that, in the end, it said nothing at all. It was a fantasy film with only an unhappy, sad fantasy to show once all the pastel colors and fashionable outfits had faded.",the matrix imagin pink neon doesnt work,i saw film open mind i readi enjoy sort way either visual actor perhap fun stori turn brain see came unfortun struck account the much hype visual experi world build got old fast the actor clichd pigeonhol hard watch may heard ryan gosl star interest charact despit movi name the movi fun first minut in fact intent written pain express writerdirector person concern we suppos frustrat reward payoff endmost concern barbi clearli model first matrix movi worst way barbi world binari place compos barbieland embodi toy live call the real world the real world name place travel matrix well barbi dark hellish landscap run machin instead resembl actual real world appear seem run evil toy compani mattel also men shown domin rude chauvinist it clearli suppos repres real world goe far fantasi unrealist one the matrix a man walk barbi sexual harass slap backsid she get arrest defend while she arrest male offic comment bodi sexual harass the toy compani execut wear suit like agent the matrix work unrealist barren industri look cubicl they also drive black suv around regard law order though charg world we get mani heavi hand speech badli woman treat the real world i lost count number time word patriarchi use i know director want express thought western societi dystopian bleak world imposs compar world in the matrix depth nuanc world barbi mostli sad the movi show fake world domin woman begin fake world domin men progress complet show u two complet incompat the bright color happi movi shown promot materi actual dark depress irredeem if meant reflect real world well far doesnt even come close if mean show fantasi world fantasi incompat depress sex solut avail it difficult complet watch barbi tri say much end said noth it fantasi film unhappi sad fantasi show pastel color fashion outfit fade
Barbie,So good but the only part I don't like is the scene when the boys take over the town apart from that it's perfect. Barbie is a heartwarming family movie with great actors and a great freaking plot. Its my favorite movie and its highly recommended for a family but there some bad words like vagina and penis. I think it should be recommended for 12 and over. The rating 12A (12 adult ) and it is 1h and 54m. If u don't like comedy movies ( I'm sure u like comedy's) than this movie is not for u. Thank u all for reading this review and I hope u read my other reviews.

Barbie's breathtaking visuals and practical effects outshine the erratic storytelling to make a fresh and innovative movie with themes that will be divisive for many.,"Barbie is a visually stunning achievement that has excelled at the box office while dividing audiences. On the one hand, Barbie amazes with extravagant practical sets and exceptional performances, but on the other hand, the story and directing feel chaotic and erratic. The target audience seems to be moms who played with Barbies and would bring their daughters to the film. Therefore, some film's themes feel more grown up than expected for a movie about a child's toy. Despite probably not being the primary target demographic, I enjoyed the film, especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's performance. They elevated the story and script to the successful giant the movie has become. The casting of Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell was perfect for the roles they portrayed. The sets and production design were some of the most impressive I have ever seen in a film! The story was unfocused and unpredictable but also fun and lighthearted. While I wouldn't say Barbie was perfect, and its themes a little too complex for a movie about a toy, its production design and unique story stood out in an era of remakes and sequels.",barbi breathtak visual practic effect outshin errat storytel make fresh innov movi theme divis mani,barbi visual stun achiev excel box offic divid audienc on one hand barbi amaz extravag practic set except perform hand stori direct feel chaotic errat the target audienc seem mom play barbi would bring daughter film therefor film theme feel grown expect movi child toy despit probabl primari target demograph i enjoy film especi margot robbi ryan gosl perform they elev stori script success giant movi becom the cast kate mckinnon will ferrel perfect role portray the set product design impress i ever seen film the stori unfocus unpredict also fun lightheart while i wouldnt say barbi perfect theme littl complex movi toy product design uniqu stori stood era remak sequel

Barbie,"7-8/10 range. I was thinking 7.5? 7.8? But it lacks what I would look for to give it an 8. Anyways, the breakdown:Visual Aesthetics:
First of all, whoever worked on the design for the set did a stellar job. Costumes, Colour Schemes, Make-up, Stage Design -- these were all excellent.Acting and character scripts:
The leads did a fantastic job with there roles. Margot brings her character to life well, and I guess that's a pun now. Gosling likewise does well with what he has, albeit it feels like we could have gotten more grounding on the Kens as characters.Some of the supporting characters were done a bit, cheesy as well, and felt a bit out of place in the wrong way. Some of this might have been delivery, but again, some of the parts were just not as well fleshed out as they needed to be.If there is an extended version, it might address the grounding on these characters.CEO characters seemed more or less appropriate as caricatures.Creator was a nice character.Overarching theme and plot:The overarching theme is meaningful, I'm not 100% certain on the execution and there is some variability between what is meant to be taken as straight forward and tongue in cheek, and that line isn't always clear. I am now talking about my own flaws in communication ;) anyways, there was a little bit of a sense of wondering where the film was trying to go exactly in terms of direction in the larger execution.The bringing in of the creator of Barbies was a brilliant conclusion which was well executed.Overall, the execution didn't quite hit the notes I was looking for, but did a fine job. I have no strong explicit complaints, but just feel more concise direction on the placement of certain lines might have benefitted the cohesive expression when looking at all levels of the story.Sountrack:
Music was well matched and did not detract. Some of the effects were a little over-used, and more daring could have been added for some scenes, but the overall main themes were a good compliment.Overall,
It was a worthwhile watch to see how this actually turned out. This film has been caught in a media firestorm because it deals with feminism and the topic of equal rights. Equal rights are not achieved in the film, but it does highlight the topic. Some viewers feel that it was ""too heavy handed"" which I can see why some scenes were a bit corny or expositive, however, not anywhere near to the level conservative critics have been complaining about this film. You'd think this film were sacrificing Jesus or Hitler. For the most part, things were handled in a reasonable way, and moreso considering the limitations for time and budget.That said, my least favourite scenes were some of the LA scenes. Perhaps it's bad memories of Venice Beach being Venice Beach, or maybe it was the camera angles.Overall,
Definitely worth a watch. Doesn't live up 100% to the hype, but definitely not remotely the same movie other ""critics"" have been claiming it to be.7.5-7.8 ish. Decent, some great aspects, some okay aspects, some cheesy aspects.Some more grounding on some scenes and characters, and a little less cheesiness in some spots and I feel it could have easily gotten to an 8+.",barbi,rang i think but lack i would look give anyway breakdownvisu aesthet first whoever work design set stellar job costum colour scheme makeup stage design excellentact charact script the lead fantast job role margot bring charact life well i guess that pun gosl likewis well albeit feel like could gotten ground ken characterssom support charact done bit cheesi well felt bit place wrong way some might deliveri part well flesh need beif extend version might address ground charactersceo charact seem le appropri caricaturescr nice characteroverarch theme plotth overarch theme meaning im certain execut variabl meant taken straight forward tongu cheek line isnt alway clear i talk flaw commun anyway littl bit sen wonder film tri go exactli term direct larger executionth bring creator barbi brilliant conclus well executedoveral execut didnt quit hit note i look fine job i strong explicit complaint feel concis direct placement certain line might benefit cohes express look level storysountrack music well match detract some effect littl overus dare could ad scene overal main theme good complimentoveral it worthwhil watch see actual turn thi film caught medium firestorm deal femin topic equal right equal right achiev film highlight topic some viewer feel heavi hand i see scene bit corni exposit howev anywher near level conserv critic complain film youd think film sacrif jesu hitler for part thing handl reason way moreso consid limit time budgetthat said least favourit scene la scene perhap bad memori venic beach venic beach mayb camera anglesoveral definit worth watch doesnt live hype definit remot movi critic claim ish decent great aspect okay aspect cheesi aspectssom ground scene charact littl le cheesi spot i feel could easili gotten
(SPOILER-FREE) - It's Only What You Bring With You,"Let's face it: this film is not supposed to be good. It certainly isn't supposed to offer much more than eye-candy and a few songs. Yet, 'Barbie' in its own way has come to house all the pieces we look for in a movie. For her first live-action story, Greta Gerwig managed to craft an experience that captures everything right, and everything wrong with what the doll has represented to generations of girls. Set design was a dream and at opening feels like the first time we saw Dorothy step into Oz. The cast carried a full load of heavy-hitters and Gosling's Ken made a few attempts to steal the show. Margot Robbie is the true star that shines as she gives much more attention, depth, and charisma than Barbie had any right to be - creating a 3D character that is both whimsical and disturbingly real. Although it is an entirely different think-piece to discuss gender roles, the fact remains that any authentic Barbie story cannot be told without it. Gerwig's real genius is that she is able to tell the story within the story without it feeling like a finger-wag. The fact is, the pacing and humor is more than enough for viewers to see themselves on both sides of the fence. Cunning, sharp, heartfelt, and hilarious, 'Barbie' is an open love letter to past, present, and future mothers and the ties that bind through the obligation of perfection. In the end - like its namesake - the film represents whatever you want it to be.

Not a movie but a long tiktok video.,"First impressions of the movie where mixed. The script is pretty much garbage. It sends a solid message about equality while somehow does the exact opossite.It tries to create a society where men and women are at the same level and all bodies and races have the same value but also does the opposite making sometimes girls look much inferior than men and men inferior than women.The movie is about laughing at how basic, stupid and ignorant the fan base of the movie really is. If you went to the theater wearing all pink and well dressed then you are what I'm talking about.I must say it was a fun movie that made me laugh at some points. It was so fun to see how ignorant the people watching this movie are that made me also laugh and be worried about how the society has fallen. I went to see the movie making a double session after seeing Oppenheimer so that may be why I notice the difference about the audience.If you are a girl and you laughed a bit too much then maybe you should go and search for a psychiatrist because if you like being made fun off then you have some problems.Basically, if you are a guy taking over a girl then you are bad. If you are a girl taking over a guy then it's all good. The movie supports the extreme left, politically btw.At the same time it also teaches guys and girls that they don't need each other and can live by their own. It's a journey about finding yourself and what it means to be a guy or a girl. It tries to take out stereotypes by saying all bodies are perfect but when Barbie gets cellulitis it's then she is ugly and wants go back to be perfect and to the usual stereotypes. Also let's include fat barbie and paralytic barbie but for some reason let's not include fat Ken or paralytic Ken and just make them all gorgeous and fit, clearly not body-shaming guys...If you are wondering why I haven't spoken about any of the plot, well... that's because there isn't one besides vibes and ideologies.I was also surprised in the good way for not having woke characters or members of the lgbtqi+ comunity. If there is a movie for it, it's this one but I'm glad they did not force any of that.It's sad to see that almost all the audience just went there to show off their pink outfits, tell everyone they have watched the movie by taking pics before or after the movie and to stay on their phones instead of watching it. I came out of the movie worried about where society is going and I think that was not supposed to happen.",not movi long tiktok video,first impress movi mix the script pretti much garbag it send solid messag equal somehow exact opossiteit tri creat societi men woman level bodi race valu also opposit make sometim girl look much inferior men men inferior womenth movi laugh basic stupid ignor fan base movi realli if went theater wear pink well dress im talk abouti must say fun movi made laugh point it fun see ignor peopl watch movi made also laugh worri societi fallen i went see movi make doubl session see oppenheim may i notic differ audienceif girl laugh bit much mayb go search psychiatrist like made fun problemsbas guy take girl bad if girl take guy good the movi support extrem left polit btwat time also teach guy girl dont need live it journey find mean guy girl it tri take stereotyp say bodi perfect barbi get cellul ugli want go back perfect usual stereotyp also let includ fat barbi paralyt barbi reason let includ fat ken paralyt ken make gorgeou fit clearli bodysham guysif wonder i havent spoken plot well that isnt one besid vibe ideologiesi also surpris good way woke charact member lgbtqi comun if movi one im glad forc thatit sad see almost audienc went show pink outfit tell everyon watch movi take pic movi stay phone instead watch i came movi worri societi go i think suppos happen
"Poor, as poor as it gets","If this was an ad for Mattel, then fair play! They've done a great job.As a film...pretty terrible!

Amazing!,"Great film which has a good balance between politics, feminism and film making. It was funny, sad and exciting, with great acting to pull it off. The set was incredible and the dances were amazing which really added to the story line. The ending was perfect and showed how barbie has impacted audiences positively and negatively. Mattel really own the so called bad barbies that they discontinued and it is clear either why they were discontinued but also maybe why they weren't necessary to be discontinued. Overall a great film and good to see with the family, it would be really recommended if you have younger children!

A very poor film,"I heard it was preachy before going to watch it, but still expected it to be a fun, easy watch. I feel like this is being rated higher because people think there's an important message in there but this shouldn't distract anyone from the fact that it's a very, very bad film with a terrible storyline. After a promising start it becomes excruciatingly boring and predictable. The storyline is what you'd expect from a poorly written children's film, but its wrapped in a heavy handed adult theme. Box office smash but it will be forgotten very quickly. Only highlights were Margot Robbie's performance and Michael Cera and Kate Mckinnons small but funny parts.",a poor film,i heard preachi go watch still expect fun easi watch i feel like rate higher peopl think there import messag shouldnt distract anyon fact bad film terribl storylin after promis start becom excruciatingli bore predict the storylin youd expect poorli written child film wrap heavi hand adult theme box offic smash forgotten quickli onli highlight margot robbi perform michael cera kate mckinnon small funni part
A Beautiful Commentary on the Real World,"This movie is everything and more. It's comedic, colorful, entertaining, heartfelt, nostalgic, and has such a truly meaningful message that's fit for everyone.While the movie pokes fun at the patriarchy, it's a beautifully written commentary on how the patriarchy affects everyone, not just women. Where Ryan Gosling's Ken was struggling to find who he really is, because the patriarchy forces him into masculinity. There's also the more obvious example of the Barbies being brainwashed into servitude.As marvelously played by Margot Robbie, Barbie feels the struggles that many women face - where we feel lost at some point in our lives. America Ferrera's monologue on how women are always criticized on every detail of their lives was extraordinary. This movie positively shows the beauty of womanhood.Barbie will definitely become a classic and a movie that will be talked about for many years to come!",a beauti commentari real world,thi movi everyth it comed color entertain heartfelt nostalg truli meaning messag that fit everyonewhil movi poke fun patriarchi beauti written commentari patriarchi affect everyon woman where ryan gosl ken struggl find realli patriarchi forc masculin there also obviou exampl barbi brainwash servitudea marvel play margot robbi barbi feel struggl mani woman face feel lost point live america ferrera monologu woman alway critic everi detail live extraordinari thi movi posit show beauti womanhoodbarbi definit becom classic movi talk mani year come
"It's an OK movie, runs a little long but funny enough to be decently entertaining","This movie is about the best movie you can make with the Barbie franchise. I still found it to be a relatively average movie. I suspect part of that may be that I'm not the originally intended audience, but it may also be that this movie wants to be a thought provoking and social commentary film while handcuffed to the Barbie IP.The casting is fine, Margot Robbie does a good job as Stereotypical Barbie, Ryan Gosling is ok as Sterotypical Ken. Simu Liu is a fun addition as are Kate McKinnon and Michael Cera. I don't know, didn't feel like there were any knockout performances nor any terrible ones.The writing is fine. Again, hands are somewhat tied because the whole movie is a pointed critique on Barbie and Mattel's spotted history as it relates to female empowerment but also capitalist consumerism. And then in the next scene they have some of the sickest product placement for a car in the Chevy Blazer EV. Still, it's a decently funny film with good self-awareness and a script that isn't afraid to take punches (rightfully so) at Mattel. So many punches in fact that I'm surprised Mattel OK'ed the script.Even if I personally didn't get much out of it, I'm sure there's messaging in there that will resonate more to other audiences. I mean there has to be because some of the dialogue is very on the nose. I'm not sure if that's a product of bad writing, constrained runtime, or the very setting of the film, but the sweeping brainwashing and the subsequent deprogramming speech are not very fleshed out; they're pretty generic speeches and not particularly rousing. Normally not a critique I'd levy on a toy movie, but for a movie with a central and visible motif on empowering the every-woman, a tired mother just trying her best, I'd expect something a little more profound.I did quite like the obscure lore that this movie brought to the spotlight. Seems to be a successful strategy pioneered by Disney's Marvel, built on by Sony's Spider-Verse, and now replicated by Mattel's Barbie. What a weird evolution. It's fun though, Alan is great, there's an entire graveyard of discontinued Barbie variants, I wish they had found a way to tie in the Mattel debacle with Computer Scientist Barbie.At just under 2 hours, the movie does feel a little long. I think there are some minor pacing issues but I'm not sure where I would fix what.Overall, it's an OK movie. Pretty much exactly the quality I'd expect out of a Barbie movie but executed in a manner I'd never have predicted. Social commentary that feels strange considering how good this movie has been for the company it criticizes.",it ok movi run littl long funni enough decent entertain,thi movi best movi make barbi franchis i still found rel averag movi i suspect part may im origin intend audienc may also movi want thought provok social commentari film handcuf barbi ipth cast fine margot robbi good job stereotyp barbi ryan gosl ok sterotyp ken simu liu fun addit kate mckinnon michael cera i dont know didnt feel like knockout perform terribl onesth write fine again hand somewhat tie whole movi point critiqu barbi mattel spot histori relat femal empower also capitalist consumer and next scene sickest product placement car chevi blazer ev still decent funni film good selfawar script isnt afraid take punch right mattel so mani punch fact im surpris mattel oke scripteven i person didnt get much im sure there messag reson audienc i mean dialogu nose im sure that product bad write constrain runtim set film sweep brainwash subsequ deprogram speech flesh theyr pretti gener speech particularli rous normal critiqu id levi toy movi movi central visibl motif empow everywoman tire mother tri best id expect someth littl profoundi quit like obscur lore movi brought spotlight seem success strategi pioneer disney marvel built soni spidervers replic mattel barbi what weird evolut it fun though alan great there entir graveyard discontinu barbi variant i wish found way tie mattel debacl comput scientist barbieat hour movi feel littl long i think minor pace issu im sure i would fix whatoveral ok movi pretti much exactli qualiti id expect barbi movi execut manner id never predict social commentari feel strang consid good movi compani critic
Decent,"I like what they did with this movie and the characters with its combining the Barbie world and the real world. Barbie starts getting ""vibes"" and has to go into the real world to find the girl who played with her to set things right and winds up in the Mattel headquarters. Something resembling chaos ensues. Ken joins her and winds up causing further damage. I like what they do in various stages of the story and with the characters. It was overall a very pleasant surprise snd a good movie with a good cast. Margot Robbie, Ryan
Gosling, America Ferrera, and Will Ferrell were all good in their roles.

Hard movie to review,"""Barbie"" to me is one of the harder movies to review because I don't know whether I liked it or not. This review will just come from the hip and i'm going to list the good and the bad and finally rate it off of what i've reviewed, so here goes...""Barbie"" is a comedy/adventure/fantasy about the doll/dolls made by Mattel but with lots of twists on the story. I loved Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie in both their respective roles of Barbie and Ken. Several other character were fun and likeable too, even the small cameo from the man you can't see. The score was fitting, the story was very much fun and entertaining and the ""musical""? Performances they put on in some scenes were great too, but where I had a problem with the movie was that at times, it just left me empty especially at that ending. Wasn't a big fan of that, could've been better. And I dislike that they, instead of putting the actual Barbie song in the end credits, they used a rap remix. At times the acting was cheesy but i'll forgive that since the movie was very self-aware. All in all... Think i'll give ""Barbie"" a 7/10. Was good but left more to be desired.",hard movi review,barbi one harder movi review i dont know whether i like thi review come hip im go list good bad final rate ive review goesbarbi comedyadventurefantasi dolldol made mattel lot twist stori i love ryan gosl margot robbi respect role barbi ken sever charact fun likeabl even small cameo man cant see the score fit stori much fun entertain music perform put scene great i problem movi time left empti especi end wasnt big fan couldv better and i dislik instead put actual barbi song end credit use rap remix at time act cheesi ill forgiv sinc movi selfawar all think ill give barbi wa good left desir

I don't want to say too much and spoil anything for those that haven't seen it yet, so just go ahead and do yourself a favor and go see it. What are you waiting for? P. S.

The plot was kind of interesting, it makes you attached to the movie, the characters were silly but in a mostly funny way, it really had its funny moments especially with Ryan Gosling as Ken he was hilarious, I liked what he did here and Margot fits perfectly no need to say more about her.The only thing that made me uncomfortable is that they were trying to send messages through this film, it's not about the manner but the quantity, a dozen of them if I'm not afraid but it wasn't that forced to be fair.Enjoy it, the Kenergy was Kenough for me!",the kenergi kenough,barbiebarbi suffer crisi lead question world existenc watch barbi i awar im go receiv exactli i thoughtbarbi fun light movi cant take seriou big pictur enjoy color dynam concept gener the plot kind interest make attach movi charact silli mostli funni way realli funni moment especi ryan gosl ken hilari i like margot fit perfectli need say herth thing made uncomfort tri send messag film manner quantiti dozen im afraid wasnt forc fairenjoy kenergi kenough
music video non-movie,"Barbie has color and some music and dancing. There's no movie in there though, as taken as a whole it's a mess of illogic and heavy handed pronouncements. The ""real word"" is as fake as a 3 dollar bill. A universe called real world might be thought of as portraying, well, the real world, but it doesn't. When straining for humor, it mostly doesn't work. Furthermore, none of the characters in Barbie are interesting or someone one wants to relate to in a narrative. Some of the historical Barbie items are interesting to look at.

Unexpected & Inspiring,"I didnt expected ill rate this movie at all.I just watched it and i totaly changed my opinion about this movie, and Barbies as a dolls. I never had a doll of a Barbie or Ken, bc i as man, when i was kid i didnt liked dolls, but this movie is much more than that.Before watching i had low expectations, because its a Barbie movie and bc of other comments i read, they were mostly negative, and now after watching the movie all of that negativity and low expectations just dissapeared.People whine about the story, but for me the story is well made. They put all positive and negative stuff about Barbies in a funny way, positive way.Main actors Margot (Barbie) and Ryan (Ken) + Will Ferrell were excellent choice for their role in this movie. I liked actually the role which W. Ferrell got, bc nobody could do that role better than him. He showed dark stuff as a CEO on a hilarious way and he alone lifted the whole movie for a very large amount. Both Margot & Ryan did their job very well for their roles. And even narator is well used.Im happy that this isnt just Barbie & Ken movie and that isnt a movie with some empty story. Near end it actually started to remind me on Pinocchio. Movie is inspiring and it can help some people if they have similar difficulties as Barbie did in their real lifes.I would give it a rating of 8, mostly bc i still dont like Barbies, bc im a man, but since im not rating the dolls, but the movie, and that same movie positively affected my night, then i will give it a 9.At least i can go to sleep now happier then i expected ill go.",unexpect inspir,i didnt expect ill rate movi alli watch totali chang opinion movi barbi doll i never doll barbi ken bc man kid didnt like doll movi much thatbefor watch low expect barbi movi bc comment read mostli neg watch movi neg low expect dissapearedpeopl whine stori stori well made they put posit neg stuff barbi funni way posit waymain actor margot barbi ryan ken will ferrel excel choic role movi i like actual role w ferrel got bc nobodi could role better he show dark stuff ceo hilari way alon lift whole movi larg amount both margot ryan job well role and even narat well usedim happi isnt barbi ken movi isnt movi empti stori near end actual start remind pinocchio movi inspir help peopl similar difficulti barbi real lifesi would give rate mostli bc still dont like barbi bc im man sinc im rate doll movi movi posit affect night give at least go sleep happier expect ill go

Loved the whole production, the set designs and costumes. But the movie dragged in parts, and it just got worst towards the end. I wish they had a solid and fun ending, but they tried to go a different way, which didnt sit well with me. Don't want to really comment about the feminism empowerment, I am all for it but it was too in your face, and this being supposed to be a light and fun movie, ruined the entertainment for me. Being a women, there are of course many issues faced in reality. But this one didn't really nail it.Among the performances Ryan Gosling was really good as Ken.

Fresh & funny surreal scenes. With big problems.,"It was going well before they began over-explaining certain issues and ideas. Determined to make points and say it like they think it is. Lengthy ramblings and reinforcement tone.On the plus side, colour and fun vibrancy in many scenes for a nice ride. Margot is great. But the dwelling on certain ideas and pushing of those ideas was drawn out, laboured.Self-referential, as if they were too scared not to. Imagine a Barbie movie that didn't come with a toxic masculinity lecture? Who would dare make that?A truly bizarre narrative intrusion at one point. Something about Margot Robbie's looks being incompatible with the Barbie character's vulnerable moment? In effect disallowing the Barbie character from having that emotion because the actor playing her is pretty? Very strange.Immature writing in many ways.

It's Barbie and It's Ken,"On a comedic level, Barbie is perfect. Obviously aware of trending topics and internet memes, the movie never fails to burst waves of laughter every three to five minutes. Every element in this film will become a punchline at one point or another, including awkward dialogues, exaggerated movements, unexpected responses, the Sex Education trio, John Cena cameo, Helen Mirren's epic one-liner, and much more. One actor to be complimented is Ryan Gosling, who bestows a childly himbo character Ken with charismatic idiocy and amusing lightheartedness, in great contrast to his previous sigma characters like K from Blade Runner 2049.In terms of story, though, not much success can be claimed. With the movie's central conflict revolve around gender inequity, Barbie highlights the problem clearly, but provides an ambiguous answer. Although Gloria's monologue was unquestionably badass, both her and Sasha's character arcs are quite unconvincing. In general, the film gives either opaque or passive solutions to gender issues, which align with mainstream opinion, but are inherently fantastical especially with the plain storyline.In my opinion, Barbie's box office wonder largely results from its marketing, whether the grand casting, the luring mystique, or the bombastic pink. And yes, the movie is incredible for its aestheticism and creativity, but the story is overly fantastical and lacking gravity.",it barbi it ken,on comed level barbi perfect obvious awar trend topic internet meme movi never fail burst wave laughter everi three five minut everi element film becom punchlin one point anoth includ awkward dialogu exagger movement unexpect respons sex educ trio john cena cameo helen mirren epic onelin much one actor compliment ryan gosl bestow childli himbo charact ken charismat idioci amus lighthearted great contrast previou sigma charact like k blade runner in term stori though much success claim with movi central conflict revolv around gender inequ barbi highlight problem clearli provid ambigu answer although gloria monologu unquestion badass sasha charact arc quit unconvinc in gener film give either opaqu passiv solut gender issu align mainstream opinion inher fantast especi plain storylinein opinion barbi box offic wonder larg result market whether grand cast lure mystiqu bombast pink and ye movi incred aesthetic creativ stori overli fantast lack graviti

One of a kind movie,"Barbie has exceeded the expectations of many viewers, what we thought was going to be a movie for ""kids"" has ended up being a movie full of social criticism, satire and a great sense of humor. The female empowerment that Greta Gerwig presents to us is relentless, showing various situations in which women find themselves involved on a daily basis, as well as various cliches that surround them.On the other hand, there is Ken who at first finds patriarchy as the best solution for society, but finally realizes that the role of women is extremely important and that without them society would collapse.The way in which Barbie has been shot is impressive, the mixture of the use of animated elements with life action makes seeing Barbie on the big screen a unique experience. I loved the duo of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, they have coexisted perfectly in Barbieland, making watching them act extremely entertaining.Without a doubt, this movie is one of a kind and I would like it to be valued for what it really is and not be forgotten like the movie about Barbie.",one kind movi,barbi exceed expect mani viewer thought go movi kid end movi full social critic satir great sen humor the femal empower greta gerwig present u relentless show variou situat woman find involv daili basi well variou clich surround themon hand ken first find patriarchi best solut societi final realiz role woman extrem import without societi would collapseth way barbi shot impress mixtur use anim element life action make see barbi big screen uniqu experi i love duo margot robbi ryan gosl coexist perfectli barbieland make watch act extrem entertainingwithout doubt movi one kind i would like valu realli forgotten like movi barbi

To say it in the first ten minutes - ""I can have feelings and use logic at the same time and it does not take away from my worth."" to have Barbie look at her body and hate it and to make her look at an old woman and see just how beautiful her ""imperfections"" make her.

Mess of a movie,"Anyone who gives this movie above a 1 star has a vested financial interest in its success. This was basically just a mess of a movie. All over the place plot with nonsense scenes and situations. There were some funny scenes but at its core, it just had no depth, logic or meaning other than Barbie v. Ken.

Hilarious with genuine touches of emotion,"I went in to this movie expecting to it to be fun based on the trove a press for it.It does not disappoint. Margot Robbie brought a depth of emotion to the role that makes it a special character and performance. America Ferrera also was sensational and is probably an under appreciated actor for as much as she consistently delivers in her films and shows.Gosling, Liu, and Kingsley Ben-Adir brought plenty of the expected levity for the Ken roles. Gosling is well known for both his dramatic and comedic abilities at this point, but selfishly watching him ham it up and be funny never gets old.As expected, the movie had plenty of ludicrously silly moments that and brought humor from a lot of different directions and perspectives.Specifically, the mini-dissection of the patriarchy and evolution of the characters to more fully realize themselves played very well to me.I could not recommend this movie enough.

An unrisky yet effective comment on gender issues,"Male loneliness is directly tied to the high value that we give to romantic relationships, as it tends undervalue any other form of love. It results in a current (and big) social problem: straight men who have zero valuable, deep and intimate relationships with people other than their girlfriends or wives. Men depend on women as a source for happiness through romantic love. That's why many straight men have no identity other than being a boyfriend, a husband, a provider.Ken and Barbie had to enter the real world to realize this, among more important and focal problems related to feminity and the place of women in society (which were precise but I don't write about because, as a cisgender man, I think is more valuable if I talk about masculinity and male problems). They question their identity and Ken realizes he doesn't know himself or his place if he doesn't have Barbie by his side.This is not something that I see discussed much in commercial cinema, so I'm glad it was and that's why I focus only in that subject in this review, because it was my favorite message related to the male characters. With the rest of the movie there are many things that could've been done better, such as the self critique/parody and the meta-irony, but the good elements surpassed the negatives ones in my opinion. It's a fun movie, it's very simple, but you know, sometimes less is more (and I think it's better that way in Barbie).It's not the movie of the year and it's definitely not Gerwig's best or deeper film, but it's worth noticing the biggest commercial flick of the year to be a sort-of gender issues 101 to people who might haven't even question their gendered role in today's society beyond ""men work, women shelter and that's screwed up"". It's as feminist as a Hollywood commercial film can be.My favorite Barbie is Hari Nef's Doctor Barbie.",an unriski yet effect comment gender issu,male loneli directli tie high valu give romant relationship tend undervalu form love it result current big social problem straight men zero valuabl deep intim relationship peopl girlfriend wive men depend woman sourc happi romant love that mani straight men ident boyfriend husband providerken barbi enter real world realiz among import focal problem relat femin place woman societi precis i dont write cisgend man i think valuabl i talk masculin male problem they question ident ken realiz doesnt know place doesnt barbi sidethi someth i see discus much commerci cinema im glad that i focu subject review favorit messag relat male charact with rest movi mani thing couldv done better self critiqueparodi metaironi good element surpass neg one opinion it fun movi simpl know sometim le i think better way barbieit movi year definit gerwig best deeper film worth notic biggest commerci flick year sortof gender issu peopl might havent even question gender role today societi beyond men work woman shelter that screw it feminist hollywood commerci film bemi favorit barbi hari nef doctor barbi
Not for little girls. Not for anyone actually.,"What could have been a cute concept was overproduced with obvious writer infighting pulling this disaster into all directions. A little girl friendly opening act quickly dissolves into act two social discussion that would leave any little girl bewildered. The family next to us described their three little ones as totally confused and everyone they heard discussing it was very disappointed with this disaster caused by feuding writers or a director who scored hilarious with ""Good Boys"". So, not for kids, and parents should wait for home viewing so they can turn it off when it wears really thin about a half hour in: the time it is realized its just not going to get any better and you turn it off thankful you didn't waste any money.",not littl girl not anyon actual,what could cute concept overproduc obviou writer infight pull disast direct a littl girl friendli open act quickli dissolv act two social discus would leav littl girl bewild the famili next u describ three littl one total confus everyon heard discus disappoint disast caus feud writer director score hilari good boy so kid parent wait home view turn wear realli thin half hour time realiz go get better turn thank didnt wast money
A Flamboyantly Doll-lightful Adventure,"My mother was the only person I could convince to go watch Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" (2023) with me, and ""wow"" am I glad we went. It's been a while since I've seen such a genuinely fun and creative movie. Originality is what the world has been longing for!The story is clever and manages to be remain lightheaded and witty, while also conveying influential messages for- and challenging the audience with questions about modern feminism and discovering who you really want to be, no matter who you are.This film is colorful and 'alive', making it a joy to view upon. The set pieces, especially in Barbieland, are brilliant- and it truly makes me want to know if they actually built out a real-life Barbieland set. Did they?!The acting was brilliant from everyone; you could tell they were all having a lot of enjoyment on set. Margot Robbie carried this film for sure, as one can come to expect from this modern superstar. It was also enlightening to see Ryan Gosling take on such a comical role while also bringing a lot of depth to the character. He has a great sense of comedic timing and humor. From what I've seen in interviews, Ryan is basically embracing his comedic genius and I love it.I usually despise singing and dancing in movies, but in this film it put a smile on my face. Not just because it was amusing to watch, but because these people can actually perform really well on these fronts. It goes without saying that the music for this film was on point as well.I highly recommend everyone to go see this film, though maybe don't watch it directly before or after ""Oppenheimer"" in case you're following the current trend.

You're supposed to love being a mother but don't talk about your kids all the damn time.,"Overall: 7.47A movie that presents a very challenging undertaking taking on the Barbie franchise with incredible originality. A film that should be lauded for its ambition, creativity, and virtuous commentary. The acting is fantastic and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling feel like the only actors that could play Barbie and Ken and they more than excel at it. It feels as though Mattel partnered with Greta Gerwig and the movies production team to help make themselves the butt of the joke and also help make one of the most powerful (if not most powerful) statement for women and young girls in our modern world. The movie suffers at times with story and structure but the dialogue, acting and visual design are top notch with so much comedic poignancy to keep you entertained throughout.Top Genres - Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy, Romance

A Barbillion Bucks,"Barbie, like The Lego Movie, is a product film based on a product so successful it doesn't need to sell said product and instead uses the guaranteed exposure to tell its own fairly unique story.Barbies of various type live in ""Barbie Land"" where every day is pink and perfect (for the Barbies at least) . When generic Barbie begins having thoughts about death and experiencing flat feet she has journey to the real world, accompanied by tag along, wannabe boyfriend Ken.Revealing much more of the story would be a bit of a spoiler given how well the marketing has kept the nitty gritty of precedings hidden but it's safe to say the ensuing story is possibly the most meta film ever made. It comments on Barbie's place in the world, some ""interesting"" missteps Matel has made with the doll, and the irony of the company having an all male board before you even get to the feminist and class culture stuff. Even the movie's casting is meta. Having Margot Robbie, the embodiment of blonde perfection , as Barbie adds an extra layer to the notion of unobtainable beauty and Ryan Gosling is genius casting as Ken, the ""sigma male"" persona certain corners of the Internet have bestowed upon him being completely flipped on its head. It obviously helps that they are both outstanding actors. The rest of the cast are also great, the denizens of Barbie Land perfectly playing out the ridiculousness of the situation without ever winking at camera and Will Ferrell in one of his best roles in years as the oddball Mattel CEO.Director Greta Gerwig performs a miraculous juggling act, balancing some fairly weighty themes with real belly laughs and somehow managing to keep a consistent tone across the most surreal two hours ever to gross over a billion dollars. It does pack a surprising emotional punch in some parts as well. There is one sequence, when they first reach the real world and Ken becomes aware of all the opportunies and positive stereotypes that men see every day, that as the father of a teenage girl was a real gut punch and one of the most subtlety effective depictions of modern day sexism you will see. The only real missteps Barbie makes are when it attempts to be too sentimental, a couple of more schmaltzy scenes feel overdone and the movie makes it's points more than adequately without them.Mainly though, the film is just very, very funny, a blast of refreshing pink air into the blockbuster scene and a fun time for everyone.8 horse out of 10 mojo dojo casa houses.",a barbillion buck,barbi like the lego movi product film base product success doesnt need sell said product instead use guarante exposur tell fairli uniqu storybarbi variou type live barbi land everi day pink perfect barbi least when gener barbi begin thought death experienc flat foot journey real world accompani tag along wannab boyfriend kenrev much stori would bit spoiler given well market kept nitti gritti preced hidden safe say ensu stori possibl meta film ever made it comment barbi place world interest misstep matel made doll ironi compani male board even get feminist class cultur stuff even movi cast meta have margot robbi embodi blond perfect barbi add extra layer notion unobtain beauti ryan gosl geniu cast ken sigma male persona certain corner internet bestow upon complet flip head it obvious help outstand actor the rest cast also great denizen barbi land perfectli play ridicul situat without ever wink camera will ferrel one best role year oddbal mattel ceodirector greta gerwig perform miracul juggl act balanc fairli weighti theme real belli laugh somehow manag keep consist tone across surreal two hour ever gross billion dollar it pack surpris emot punch part well there one sequenc first reach real world ken becom awar opportuni posit stereotyp men see everi day father teenag girl real gut punch one subtleti effect depict modern day sexism see the real misstep barbi make attempt sentiment coupl schmaltzi scene feel overdon movi make point adequ without themmainli though film funni blast refresh pink air blockbust scene fun time everyon hors mojo dojo casa hous

lighthearted and fun,"I definitely enjoyed watching it. It was light hearted and fun. However, I do find the asethetic a bit too bright for the eyes. Ironic. I know. Just personal preference. Music too loud at times too.I do like the message it gets across. It does make me think about the power imbalance of genders and possibly how all genders are oppressed under the patriarchy. It was pretty well done considering how many messages they need to delivers in such a short time. However, I do wish the story was a little bit deeper and that the twists and turns are a little less straight forward. Too much to ask?

"""Humans only have one ending.

"Entertaining, silly summer movie but not really a funny comedy","Overall, this movie was about what I expected. It was a fun, summer blockbuster packed with stars and it felt like a nice, fresh break from all the superhero movies and rehashed stories that have been pushed out lately. It's not perfect, and I feel the messaging at times was too blunt, but the elements of the movie that were silly and enjoyable balanced it outPros:
1) best part of the movie is the soundtrack. I really liked it and the song by Billie Eilish that they played at the end has been replaying in my head ever since
2) the cast is also really good. Robbie and Gosling fit the roles perfectly and did a good job of adding layers to otherwise one-dimensional characters
3) the writing was generally pretty good, and there were several scenes that I feel like packed a decent emotional punchCons:
1) probably my biggest con is that the movie isn't very funny. It's written like it should be a comedy; it's silly, it's fun, and it's entertaining, but the jokes aren't that great. Even though the theatre was full, the audience was very quiet during some of the jokes. For example, Will Ferrell tried very hard, but the role he played didn't really have any good jokes to work with. The movie leaned into the silliness of its world, but seemed afraid to lean into the silliness enough in order to make a truly funny film.",entertain silli summer movi realli funni comedi,overal movi i expect it fun summer blockbust pack star felt like nice fresh break superhero movi rehash stori push late it perfect i feel messag time blunt element movi silli enjoy balanc outpro best part movi soundtrack i realli like song billi eilish play end replay head ever sinc cast also realli good robbi gosl fit role perfectli good job ad layer otherwis onedimension charact write gener pretti good sever scene i feel like pack decent emot punchcon probabl biggest con movi isnt funni it written like comedi silli fun entertain joke arent great even though theatr full audienc quiet joke for exampl will ferrel tri hard role play didnt realli good joke work the movi lean silli world seem afraid lean silli enough order make truli funni film
"Mind numbingly stupid, boring and misses the mark","I spent seven dollars hiring this movie to watch on a Friday night with my wife hearing good reviews and expecting some depth and some Baz Lehman type creativity. Instead, I was bored to death through a terribly orchestrated, extremely painfully scripted shocking excuse of a film which has wasted two hours of my life which I will never be able to recover. I feel dumber as a result of watching Barbie, flustered and frustrated that my Friday night has been consumed by utter nonsense. While there was much opportunity to provide deep commentary on gender inequalities, patriarchy, and imbalances in the construction and structural deficiencies in modern Western society, this film missed the mark and injected a constant sense of candy-like juvenile stupidity over 120 minutes of which I will be forever regretful of losing.",mind numbingli stupid bore miss mark,i spent seven dollar hire movi watch friday night wife hear good review expect depth baz lehman type creativ instead i bore death terribl orchestr extrem pain script shock excus film wast two hour life i never abl recov i feel dumber result watch barbi fluster frustrat friday night consum utter nonsens while much opportun provid deep commentari gender inequ patriarchi imbal construct structur defici modern western societi film miss mark inject constant sen candylik juvenil stupid minut i forev regret lose
<3,"This movie was so perfect especially as someone who has grown up with Barbie and was in pure awe of her from birth to the age of 12. I was forced to grow up due to peer pressure when I hit twelve so bye bye Barbie. I always regretted doing that because I wasn't ready to say goodbye but everyone else my age was. It breaks my soul seeing young girls, younger than I was letting go of their childhood so quick, trying to keep up with the older teen trends. It breaks my soul because if I was one of those girls I would be crying for my Barbie while conforming to society. Gloria's speech absolutely rocked my world. I need that tattooed in my brain, Greta is an absolute inspiration to women and girls everywhere. One thing about Barbie is I would not have an education without her. When I started school I refused to do my work unless I was promised a Barbie when I returned home, and it worked. If Barbie had not inspired women so long ago, I would probably not have completed my education as I would have found there to be no point. One thing is that I am sad or is a Barbie movie for one reason only, men will not likely see this. My brother and dad had no interest in even looking at promotion or trailers, there is no way I can get them to see this masterpiece, and they NEED to see this it is so important. If there is one movie that can change the course of history it is this one, as the introduction of Barbie did. I'm so proud and excited for Greta Gerwig and what is to come. As a newly out of school 18 year old my passion is to become a director or an actress, and Greta's work delights me everyday because of Greta, I have a chance. Before Greta's movie, I actually never heard of a female director in film, so it never even came into my head as a possibility before Greta came in. This movie has come at a perfect time for me as I turned 18 last month so this is my kickstart to womanhood, and what a way to start. I ask every woman and girl to watch this and I ask them to drag whichever man in their lives that they can. This movie is the epitome of ""yes"" there are no other words to perfectly signify this. Now, after all the mushy stuff, the humour in this film was perfect, there was never a cringy joke moment unless it was intended that way, and they never put a joke in a bad place. I was slightly worried the album may overshadow the movie, but it was perfect, never took anything away from the movie. Ryan Gosling did a fantastic job because I really believed he was Ken, nothing in me could say ""yeah that's Ryan"". Margot did a superb performance of Barbie, it is hard to play a doll that is perfect yet is experiencing an existential crisis of emotion, she deserves more praise.",,thi movi perfect especi someon grown barbi pure awe birth age i forc grow due peer pressur i hit twelv bye bye barbi i alway regret i wasnt readi say goodby everyon el age it break soul see young girl younger i let go childhood quick tri keep older teen trend it break soul i one girl i would cri barbi conform societi gloria speech absolut rock world i need tattoo brain greta absolut inspir woman girl everywher one thing barbi i would educ without when i start school i refus work unless i promis barbi i return home work if barbi inspir woman long ago i would probabl complet educ i would found point one thing i sad barbi movi one reason men like see my brother dad interest even look promot trailer way i get see masterpiec need see import if one movi chang cours histori one introduct barbi im proud excit greta gerwig come a newli school year old passion becom director actress greta work delight everyday greta i chanc befor greta movi i actual never heard femal director film never even came head possibl greta came thi movi come perfect time i turn last month kickstart womanhood way start i ask everi woman girl watch i ask drag whichev man live thi movi epitom ye word perfectli signifi now mushi stuff humour film perfect never cringi joke moment unless intend way never put joke bad place i slightli worri album may overshadow movi perfect never took anyth away movi ryan gosl fantast job i realli believ ken noth could say yeah that ryan margot superb perform barbi hard play doll perfect yet experienc existenti crisi emot deserv prais

Greta Gerwig One of the Most Unique Voices in Hollywood,"What a cinematic experience. The mediatic effect that this film is having and will have is beyond imagination. I don't know where to start. I feel like Greta is kind of an underrated director but one of the most unique voices in Hollywood. This film is iconic. Using the character and icon of Barbie to tell and send such strong messages is something that not everyone can do. Throughout the film I was always connecting it to Disney's Soul, due to particular sequences that were so strong and that convey the same message (Barbie experiencing the real life for the first time): life is unique, a beautiful gift that it's worth exploring and enjoying despite its suffering - using this solid base to talk about crucial matters like politics, patriarchy, feminism, life as a woman in all its aspects, all in a really enjoyable, beautifully crafted comedic way. Barbie (and the married writers) manages to unite different kinds of genres (musical - Ryan Gosling is sublime in musicals... you know what I mean -, bits of war sequences and the dramatic layer) in a special way. This movie is near to perfection. The epilogue really adds to that perfection, with a heart-wrenching soundtrack by Billie Eilish and some stunning visuals and another expected brilliant performance by Margot Robbie. It's her year, and she deserves all of it.

Truly fantastic,"It was a literal cinematic master piece. It was comedic, touching, educational, ground breaking.It touches upon feminism, misogyny, patriarchy, women's relationship with themselves.It showed a utopia run by women, Barbie land wasn't perfect, the kens were ignored but not hated, undervalued but not sexualized.In a world meant to mirror patriarchy, we saw a difference in treatment that really opened people's eyes.It also highlighted how the patriarchy is toxic to all involved including men, it touched on the lack of emotional intelligence men have, it highlighted toxic masculinity and overall critique of how men and women have been interacting with each other since the beginning of time.The hardest thing about watching this movie is knowing that there will be a group of people who interpret this as ""hate"" when it couldn't be further from the truth and the audience who rejects the messages this film shows are the group of people who need this education the most.The best part of this movie was seeing women of all ages come to the movie theater to laugh, cry and wake up mentally, together.Overall this movie shows the struggle of women and girlhood in a patriarchal society and how it not only demeans women but strips men of their validity, forcing men to grow up disconnected from their emotions and experiences of others and how important it is to bridge the gap between genders to create a BETTER world not just for women but for men as well.This film is truly for everyone and powerful enough to change the trajectory of society.

"A Dazzling Dive into Feminism, Perfection, and Societal Expectations :)","Hello,
Upon watching ""Barbie,"" directed by Greta Gerwig, I was immediately struck by the breathtaking visual spectacle the film offers. The vibrant universe and the ensemble cast, led by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, transported me through a range of emotions. Robbie, in particular, impressed me with her charisma and depth.The plot of the film, set in the Barbie Land where perfection is the norm, seemed to me a metaphor for our society's relentless need for perfection and the stigmas associated with imperfection. I felt the film raises pertinent questions about gender dynamics, societal norms, and the challenges faced by women, albeit sometimes a tad overtly.Many have lauded the technical aspects of the film, such as the genuine soundstage, impeccable costumes, and memorable musical numbers. However, what stood out the most to me is the film's commitment to pushing boundaries. While the marketing showcased the film as a whimsical take on the iconic doll, ""Barbie"" goes way beyond mere glitter.Like any film that tries to juggle societal commentary and entertainment, ""Barbie"" might not resonate with everyone. However, I view it as a brave attempt that defies norms, much like its main character. Would I recommend it? Absolutely. It's a film that deserves to be seen, if not for its visual splendor, then for its remarkable performances.",a dazzl dive femin perfect societ expect,hello upon watch barbi direct greta gerwig i immedi struck breathtak visual spectacl film offer the vibrant univers ensembl cast led margot robbi ryan gosl transport rang emot robbi particular impress charisma depthth plot film set barbi land perfect norm seem metaphor societi relentless need perfect stigma associ imperfect i felt film rais pertin question gender dynam societ norm challeng face woman albeit sometim tad overtlymani laud technic aspect film genuin soundstag impecc costum memor music number howev stood film commit push boundari while market showcas film whimsic take icon doll barbi goe way beyond mere glitterlik film tri juggl societ commentari entertain barbi might reson everyon howev i view brave attempt defi norm much like main charact would i recommend absolut it film deserv seen visual splendor remark perform
A Glamourous but Poorly Executed Product,"In Barbieland, Stereotypical Barbie, played by Margot Robbie, experiences changes both mentally and physically, much to the surprise of the other Barbies. To find the answers she is looking for, Stereotypical Barbie must venture out into the real world, accompanied by her Ken, played by Ryan Gosling. On the plus side, the production design is striking. Barbieland is visually interesting, managing to feel fake, but lived in at the same time. The actors seem to have fun in the roles they are playing, Ryan Gosling's Ken being a stand out, making the best of the material he has. Margot Robbie also fulfills the role at playing a believable Barbie. Unfortunately, the overall execution of the film was disappointing. Most of the humor didn't land for me, though it did have its moments. Then there is the mixed messaging regarding gender roles. The film clearly states what it is trying to say (not subtle at all), but at the same time, undermines it through poor writing and characterization. Likewise, other attempts for the story to get deep end up falling flat by getting in its own way. While Barbie has its moments, it ends up getting held back by poorly executed ideas. Final verdict: 5/10.",a glamour poorli execut product,in barbieland stereotyp barbi play margot robbi experi chang mental physic much surpris barbi to find answer look stereotyp barbi must ventur real world accompani ken play ryan gosl on plu side product design strike barbieland visual interest manag feel fake live time the actor seem fun role play ryan gosl ken stand make best materi margot robbi also fulfil role play believ barbi unfortun overal execut film disappoint most humor didnt land though moment then mix messag regard gender role the film clearli state tri say subtl time undermin poor write character likewis attempt stori get deep end fall flat get way while barbi moment end get held back poorli execut idea final verdict
Loved it!,"As we all know the title of the movie suggest fun, tons of 'cheesy' moments, drama and a lot of imaginations. I entered the theater expecting the same and placed all my expectations low and just go how the film flows. Surprisingly, it has a lot of funny moments in the film, at times 'silly', but it was all understandable and placed creatively and entertaining. Margot Robbie as ""Barbie"" was surely a perfect role of her, while Ryan Gosling as ""Ken"" did the same and he was more funnier as expected! Visual effects were cool to watch and soundtrack was for me, a phenomenal!

Watch it in 70MM if you dare !!!!,"I watched this movie on an IMAX theater in my hometown (Qatif); it's considered a 70MM
cinema in our standards.. As everything was vividly pink, that particular experience made my eyes very sore!! Despite that, I can safely
say that the Barbie film is somehow a funny ridiculous film and I would confidently recommend to watch it over watching Nolan masterpiece of garbage (oppenheimer).Is it boring? Mayyyybe but I don't think so.. does it need a 70MM IMAX? The answer is No No and No.. However, I strongly recommend to go and watch it in 70MM IMAX for the following reasons: the acting is acceptable; the plot is extremely silly; nudity and sex are alomst Zerrrro; you will witness different kinds of Barbie e.g. Skinny, overweight Barbie and more..
Simply put, it wins the Oscar for the most ridiculous movie of the year. So, stop the hate and go give it a genius try.",watch mm dare,i watch movi imax theater hometown qatif consid mm cinema standard a everyth vividli pink particular experi made eye sore despit i safe say barbi film somehow funni ridicul film i would confid recommend watch watch nolan masterpiec garbag oppenheimeri bore mayyyyb i dont think need mm imax the answer no no no howev i strongli recommend go watch mm imax follow reason act accept plot extrem silli nuditi sex alomst zerrrro wit differ kind barbi eg skinni overweight barbi simpli put win oscar ridicul movi year so stop hate go give geniu tri
I don't think it's as funny as everyone says,"Why are so many people so obsessed with this movie. Yes it has some funny moment and good jokes. But a lot of them aren't as funny as they think. The overacting from the Ken's is pretty funny the first few times but after like one and a half hours it's pretty lame. Also what role does Will Ferrell play. It doesn't make any sense or advances the plot in some way. I think most people see the movie like me average but still entertaining. So back to my question why are some people, mostly men surprisingly, so obsessed with this movie. Is there a message most of us don't see? I also asked some female friends of mine and they also thought the same as I.",i dont think funni everyon say,whi mani peopl ob movi ye funni moment good joke but lot arent funni think the overact ken pretti funni first time like one half hour pretti lame also role will ferrel play it doesnt make sen advanc plot way i think peopl see movi like averag still entertain so back question peopl mostli men surprisingli ob movi is messag u dont see i also ask femal friend mine also thought i
A Thought-Provoking Tale with Vibrant Visuals and Stellar Performances,"Barbie is an incredible movie that will entertain, as long as you can understand the lessons that modern society should learn and not get triggered. It aims to speak about the complexities of the relationship between men and women in our world in a simple and understandable way. I truly believe that everyone should watch the film, but if I had to pick a specific group to tell, I would choose late adolescence and above women. I believe the film's message will both speak to them where they may currently find themselves in life as well as lead them to reflect on their past hurt and misunderstandings as well as their future. Besides all of that, the soundtrack of this movie is energetic and grasps people into the film right away. The vibrant colors and impressive prop design deserve a lot of credit as it makes everything feel alive. The script is written perfectly for most characters, and everything is enhanced by the actors. Margot Robbie plays her role perfectly, hitting each theme that Barbie must take in perfectly. Ryan Gosling is a fantastic supporting actor, taking the silliness and seriousness of Ken to great areas in a simple and fun way. America Ferrera is great and delivers one of the most powerful performances in 2023. Ariana Greenblatt is fantastic as a growing teen in need of a lesson, and everyone else does a great job also, doing whatever they needed to do. One of my biggest issues with the film is the plotline involving Will Ferrell. Although I love him, I felt that the plot involving Mattel padded the runtime and did not do anything for me that was truly impactful the way everything else in the movie was. Overall, it is a must-watch, and if you get yourself in the right mindset and open yourself to its themes, this may have you in tears.",a thoughtprovok tale vibrant visual stellar perform,barbi incred movi entertain long understand lesson modern societi learn get trigger it aim speak complex relationship men woman world simpl understand way i truli believ everyon watch film i pick specif group tell i would choos late adolesc woman i believ film messag speak may current find life well lead reflect past hurt misunderstand well futur besid soundtrack movi energet grasp peopl film right away the vibrant color impress prop design deserv lot credit make everyth feel aliv the script written perfectli charact everyth enhanc actor margot robbi play role perfectli hit theme barbi must take perfectli ryan gosl fantast support actor take silli serious ken great area simpl fun way america ferrera great deliv one power perform ariana greenblatt fantast grow teen need lesson everyon el great job also whatev need one biggest issu film plotlin involv will ferrel although i love i felt plot involv mattel pad runtim anyth truli impact way everyth el movi overal mustwatch get right mindset open theme may tear

I hope to see some elements from lgbti+ but it did not bothered me at all. Planning to go and see again.Ryan Gosling, he literally delivered his best.

Something was missing,"I enjoyed the creation of the Barbie world, the costumes, set design, and I think the angle they took in terms of themes was interesting and relevant. The script, however, was not that solid.They were going for a direct, transparent, explain the deep themes of the story type of dialogue, but it often had a hard time landing. Particularly at the beginning. Some things felt spoon-fed to the audience, as if they weren't going to understand the givens of Ken realizing he loved the patriarchy because he felt he had never had any voice in Barbie Land. We visually understand it, but then it is explained a fee times through on the nose dialogue which felt unnecessary.The pacing of the film feels a bit awkward at times. You also never fuuully connect with the characters and their struggles, even though Margot Roby and Ryan Gosling are amazing actors and enjoyable to watch. You're following a line of events and laid out comments about the patriarchy and the place of women in todays world. But it was exactly the most profound (which is fiiiine, it's a movie about a doll after-all, but if they were going for this pov they should've dug deeper, in my opinion).I love all the actors involved, and the work of Greta Gerwig and the work of Noah Baumbach. But this wasn't their best work.I would still recommend seeing it to form your own opinion. You can still enjoy the world, the acting, and have a laugh here and there. Also, for people who have never taken a look at our binary, sexist, and patriarchal society, it could be eye opening. For my part, I often think about how exhausting it is to live in a world where men are in most positions of power and impose their ways on others, particularly women, so I wanted more out of the argument of the movie.

Not what I expected,"As of today's date, I would say this is the film produced by Luckychap Entertainment that I've liked the least, despite a more than promising trailer. Despite a perfect cast (Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling seem to be born to play these roles, and the adorable America Ferrera & Emma Mackey are always a delight to have on screen) + sets & atmosphere that exceeded my expectations, I wasn't convinced by the storytelling at the end. The first half of the film is great, but things get complicated when Barbie & Ken leave Barbieland, and here we fall into the trap of a war of the sexes, when I think it would have been more appropriate to try and raise awareness of the fact that ""domination"" never serves anyone. In short, the film is worth seeing, but I have to admit that given my expectations of it, I'm a little disappointed, even if the costumes/settings/acting are stunning.",not i expect,a today date i would say film produc luckychap entertain ive like least despit promis trailer despit perfect cast margot robbi ryan gosl seem born play role ador america ferrera emma mackey alway delight screen set atmospher exceed expect i wasnt convinc storytel end the first half film great thing get complic barbi ken leav barbieland fall trap war sex i think would appropri tri rais awar fact domin never serv anyon in short film worth see i admit given expect im littl disappoint even costumessettingsact stun
It's a lot of pink,"I was prepared for anything with this movie, it absolutely had some funny parts...like pretending to eat etc.But it was very preachy, women are awesome. We don't need Barbie to explain it to us.And then there's the dancing and needless songs.I absolutely love Margo and Ryan, they are both fantastic actors, I just would have loved the movie if they took it in a different direction.Some parts are very cringe worthy, I had to skip ahead, couldn't even watch some scenes.The idea of Barbie coming to the real world (ideally in a less goofy way) is enough for a interesting movie, in my opinion.But decide for yourself.",it lot pink,i prepar anyth movi absolut funni partslik pretend eat etcbut preachi woman awesom we dont need barbi explain usand there danc needle songsi absolut love margo ryan fantast actor i would love movi took differ directionsom part cring worthi i skip ahead couldnt even watch scenesth idea barbi come real world ideal le goofi way enough interest movi opinionbut decid
The Style !,"Greta Gerwig's style is jumping through the screen. The cinematography and set designs are brilliant here, as Barbie goes from Barbie World to the real world. Gotta say, it's particularly touching. I didn't expect to get emotional but the movie got me one or two times. Margot Robbie is a star as always, and her acting absolutely delivers, showing the inner conflicts of the character, all in nuance and sincerity.This film is definitely not for kids, as it focuses on problems and dilemmas adults have to deal with. The writing isn't perfect by any means, but overall Barbie is a pretty fun adventure.",the style,greta gerwig style jump screen the cinematographi set design brilliant barbi goe barbi world real world got ta say particularli touch i didnt expect get emot movi got one two time margot robbi star alway act absolut deliv show inner conflict charact nuanc sinceritythi film definit kid focus problem dilemma adult deal the write isnt perfect mean overal barbi pretti fun adventur
"A largely positive message, wrapped in a fun package but the execution could have been improved","Firstly, the marketing for Barbie was great. The cinema was full of people wearing Pink when I watched Barbie on Friday and Oppenheimer on Saturday.Greta Gerwig largely succeeded in creating a fun film that gets her message across although it sometimes became a bit heavy handed at the expense of the narrative and tempo of the Movie.Barbie takes on the noble cause of trying to undo the message portrayed by its early history, reposition the expectations of females (and Barbie dolls) and shine a light on the patriarchy which exists in our society. It's a movie based on a kids toy but aimed at an older demographic who can internalise these messages.The opening act was fantastic. We were introduced to a fantasy Barbie Land which is everything we could have hoped for. The set design in immense and filled with predominantly modern day Barbies living their dream life in Doll houses. Margot Robbie, who plays ''stereotypical Barbie' was made for the roll and Ryan Gosling is great as Ken. The supporting cast are also a lot of fun.In the second act we are given a cause to enter the Real World where we are introduced to Will Ferrall and the Mattel Corporation. They were the least interesting part of the movie. One of the main issue is that they weren't realistic and blurred the lines between the tone of Barbie Land and the real world. Whilst some of their jokes were funny a number of them missed, something that was true of the movie as a whole. We are also introduced to other real world characters who have a bigger role to play.In the third act, things pick up again as we are able to explore Barbie Land. We get an stand-off between competing ideologies which is largely entertaining and funny. In this act there are a number key moments which reinforce the message of the film followed by several resolutions which may or may not please the general audience. There are parts of this act which could have been done better especially when it comes to the overall workings of Barbie Land.Barbie teased being a simple movie about a doll and instead went for the bigger goal of being a strong feminist movie and calling out the patriarchy. Overall there is a lot of fun to be had with the Barbie movie. It aims to deliver a positive message to its core audience however this sometimes comes at the expense of the narrative and tempo of movie as a whole.I never imagined that there would be so many thoughts and discussion to have post a Barbie movie. If you are caught up in The Barbie hype it's worth seeing in the cinema otherwise watch it when it is released to the masses.",a larg posit messag wrap fun packag execut could improv,firstli market barbi great the cinema full peopl wear pink i watch barbi friday oppenheim saturdaygreta gerwig larg succeed creat fun film get messag across although sometim becam bit heavi hand expens narr tempo moviebarbi take nobl caus tri undo messag portray earli histori reposit expect femal barbi doll shine light patriarchi exist societi it movi base kid toy aim older demograph internalis messagesth open act fantast we introduc fantasi barbi land everyth could hope the set design immens fill predominantli modern day barbi live dream life doll hous margot robbi play stereotyp barbi made roll ryan gosl great ken the support cast also lot funin second act given caus enter real world introduc will ferral mattel corpor they least interest part movi one main issu werent realist blur line tone barbi land real world whilst joke funni number miss someth true movi whole we also introduc real world charact bigger role playin third act thing pick abl explor barbi land we get standoff compet ideolog larg entertain funni in act number key moment reinforc messag film follow sever resolut may may plea gener audienc there part act could done better especi come overal work barbi landbarbi tea simpl movi doll instead went bigger goal strong feminist movi call patriarchi overal lot fun barbi movi it aim deliv posit messag core audienc howev sometim come expens narr tempo movi wholei never imagin would mani thought discus post barbi movi if caught the barbi hype worth see cinema otherwis watch releas mass
"If you're in the mood for persistent CGI set decoration, watch ""Free Guy"" instead","This is unquestionably one of the worst films I've ever watched. When I found out Greta Gerwig wrote and directed it, that was the only reason I could even muster to try to watch it. I'm assuming that the whole concept was so dreadful chiefly because Mattel was one of the production companies behind it. As typically happens, heavily hyped films cannot live up to the flackery. This was no exception. I suppose it's possible I did not like it because I am not female and was not a child who spent much time playing with dolls, so I just cannot identify with the fantasy world it tries to create, or with the pseudo-feminist triumph storyline, which is not really all that triumphant in the end, though I hope the gist is that it does not need to be a triumph as much as it needs to be a catalyst for coequal cooperation.Ultimately, ""Barbie"" has a poor, silly script, and fails on various levels: it does not work as a musical, the music is generally awful; it does not work as a comedy, the only effective joke is the very last dialog line of the film; it does not work as romance because the characters don't even think about sex; it does not work as a sociopolitical allegory because none of the characters are believable and none are even sympathetic. The film failed to make me care about anyone in it.At the end of the day, there were three good things in it: Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie came closest to being believable and likable; America Ferrera's ""Never..."" speech was the only well-written and well-played dramatic moment; and Rhea Perlman as the inventor, and the climactic scene of Barbie's self-discovery that she sweetly supported. I believe stars Robbie and Gosling gave director Gerwig what she wanted of them, but why write protagonist characters that stupid and dull? And how did Mattel let this get released without noticing that that is the overriding characteristic of the protagonists and the whole film?Was this film original and inventive? Somewhat; but it was also so derivative of the continuous marketing of the real product in the real world that the pink and the other candy-coating colors simply became tiresome, lifeless, unaffecting, and creepily commercial and materialistic. I suppose a story like this could have become a better production than this one, (it does *look* sleek and professional, but it doesn't *sound* like those attributes), and I'm really not convinced this story needed to be made. It's not ""Lady Bird,"" and not worthy of that film's creative force.",if your mood persist cgi set decor watch free guy instead,thi unquestion one worst film ive ever watch when i found greta gerwig wrote direct reason i could even muster tri watch im assum whole concept dread chiefli mattel one product compani behind a typic happen heavili hype film live flackeri thi except i suppos possibl i like i femal child spent much time play doll i identifi fantasi world tri creat pseudofeminist triumph storylin realli triumphant end though i hope gist need triumph much need catalyst coequal cooperationultim barbi poor silli script fail variou level work music music gener aw work comedi effect joke last dialog line film work romanc charact dont even think sex work sociopolit allegori none charact believ none even sympathet the film fail make care anyon itat end day three good thing kate mckinnon weird barbi came closest believ likabl america ferrera never speech wellwritten wellplay dramat moment rhea perlman inventor climact scene barbi selfdiscoveri sweetli support i believ star robbi gosl gave director gerwig want write protagonist charact stupid dull and mattel let get releas without notic overrid characterist protagonist whole filmwa film origin invent somewhat also deriv continu market real product real world pink candyco color simpli becam tiresom lifeless unaffect creepili commerci materialist i suppos stori like could becom better product one look sleek profession doesnt sound like attribut im realli convinc stori need made it ladi bird worthi film creativ forc

It is what it is,"Barbie is a fun little movie that is, at its core, a satire on traditional gender roles in society. Thrown in is some mild commentary on materialism and how reality seldom (if ever) lives up to our youthful expectations. Some people have claimed the movie posits a subversive anti-male agenda but I can't see it that way. It's simply a movie, based on a toy, that dares to actually not take itself seriously. Look at other films in this genre such as Battleship, GI Joe and the Transformers films. All take ludicrous concepts and imbue them with a ridiculous amount of dark ""realism"". Barbie doesn't do that. It reveals that it's a joke in the very first scene.Is this a great movie? Absolutely not. But it is fun, entertaining summertime fluff. Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling both look and act perfectly plastic. The set design is brilliantly colorful and the whole thing moves at a pleasant pace.

Greta did it!,"Greta Gerwig did it. Broke the ceiling financially for a movie directed by a woman.I like all of her work and the Barbie theme was a daring one to take on. Then again she created a powerful version of Little Women. I also figured if Isa Rae agreed to be in this, there had to be more to it.It was so much funnier than expected. They figured out how to not make a parody of Barbie and Ken. That's no small task.I don't want to give away anything because everyone is going to see themselves in this in another way. It's clever, thoughtful, and so funny. The actors performed to perfection.There's a lot to unpack in this movie. I want to watch it again.

Everything is good in the movie except few things, which we will talk about in the negative. And Yaa the song in the end ""What was i made for"" By Billie Eilish was so good so extra thumbs up for that too.Talking about the negative... First few minutes I feel like what the hell is happening on the screen. But once I get into the movie it was a good watch. And in the second half there one was a fight scene which looked like an overdramatic thing to me.So, if you are a guy and looking forward to watching it, my opinion is that You should give it a try and off course others should also give it a try because it a good movie to watch with great social massage.I am sure you will not regret my recommendation.",unexpectedli good,i watch movi watch i didnt mani expect but turn good so yaa thumb i guy review watch barbi movietalk posit barbi movi give strong massag gender equal woman empower everyth good movi except thing talk neg and yaa song end what made by billi eilish good extra thumb tootalk neg first minut i feel like hell happen screen but i get movi good watch and second half one fight scene look like overdramat thing meso guy look forward watch opinion you give tri cours other also give tri good movi watch great social massagei sure regret recommend
Life in Plastic It's Fantastic,"Barbie (2023) is a fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig and co-written by her and Noah Baumbach, based on the iconic fashion dolls by Mattel. The film stars Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, who go on a journey of self-discovery after their expulsion from Barbieland, a matriarchal society where all women are successful and independent. Along the way, they encounter various challenges and surprises in the real world, a multifaceted exploration of existentialism, consumerism, and femininity.Barbie 2023 is a delightful and refreshing film that celebrates Barbie as a cultural icon and a role model for girls and women of all ages. It is incredibly funny and smart, with a terrific ensemble cast that all go for it in the best ways. It is also a clever and creative film that explores various themes and issues that are relevant and relatable to today's society. It is a film that can appeal to a wide range of audiences, from fans of Barbie to fans of comedy to fans of cinema. It is a film that deserves to be seen and enjoyed on the big screen.

"OVERRATED AND OVERHYPED, BUT A GOOD FILM","Greta Gerwig's overhyped and vastly overrated pink feminist fantasy that became a mega-hit at the global box office. For me the highlight of this movie is the opening in the world of ""Barbieland"" which is colorful and visually stunning with some campy humor and a look into the repetitive lives of these living dolls, particularly the stereotypical Barbie, played brilliantly played by Margo Robbie who is pure perfection in the role, and her hunky dimwitted boyfriend Ken, terrifically played by Ryan Gosling who earned an Oscar nomination for his scene-stealing turn, but once Barbie and Ken leave Barbieland and enter the real world the entire lighthearted tone of the film ends, it becomes a negative and turns into a weird war between men and women, I found this part of the film very boring and did not find it funny or entertaining, it turns preachy and dialogue-heavy. Gerwig's direction is solid, but the most impressive thing about this film is its sensational production design which is amazing, some cute musical numbers with Barbie and Ken, and the superb cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto. The supporting performances are all good, but why America Ferrera got an Oscar nomination for her okay performance is beyond me, however special kudos must go to Rhea Perlman who delivers an wonderfully endearing performance in an extended cameo. The film is a disappointment to me that could of been way better, no masterpiece here just a good film.",overr and overhyp but a good film,greta gerwig overhyp vastli overr pink feminist fantasi becam megahit global box offic for highlight movi open world barbieland color visual stun campi humor look repetit live live doll particularli stereotyp barbi play brilliantli play margo robbi pure perfect role hunki dimwit boyfriend ken terrif play ryan gosl earn oscar nomin scenest turn barbi ken leav barbieland enter real world entir lightheart tone film end becom neg turn weird war men woman i found part film bore find funni entertain turn preachi dialogueheavi gerwig direct solid impress thing film sensat product design amaz cute music number barbi ken superb cinematographi rodrigo prieto the support perform good america ferrera got oscar nomin okay perform beyond howev special kudo must go rhea perlman deliv wonder endear perform extend cameo the film disappoint could way better masterpiec good film
Bafflingly mediocre,"I have been thinking for 2 days and still I have no idea who the target audience for this film is. The first half of this movie is not bad at all but once Barbie and Ken leave barbieland the movie just completely falls apart. The message shoved in your face way too much and isnt subtle at all, characters that are set up early on are completely forgotten by the 3rd act in a bloated script filled with unnecissarily complex feministic views. For a movie about a children's toy, the dialogue is often much too complex and theres no way in hell a child is going to be able to understand whats going on; several lines left me scratching my head as the dialogue is way too overly complex. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are excellent casting choices with Gosling going above and beyond, nailing all of the comedic moments and elevating all of the material he was given to work with.For a movie I was incredibly excited for, I was severely let down and honestly cannot say I recommend this movie to anyone. If you are going to only see one blockbuster this summer, make it Mission Impossible or Oppenheimer, you are not missing out on much here.",bafflingli mediocr,i think day still i idea target audienc film the first half movi bad barbi ken leav barbieland movi complet fall apart the messag shove face way much isnt subtl charact set earli complet forgotten rd act bloat script fill unnecissarili complex feminist view for movi child toy dialogu often much complex there way hell child go abl understand what go sever line left scratch head dialogu way overli complex ryan gosl margot robbi excel cast choic gosl go beyond nail comed moment elev materi given work withfor movi i incred excit i sever let honestli say i recommend movi anyon if go see one blockbust summer make mission imposs oppenheim miss much
Movie of the summer!,"BarbieDazzling, heartfelt and brilliantly funny. Comedy of the year, movie of the summer!Barbie is a beautiful blend of comedy and heart. Aided deftly by colourful visuals, Greta Gerwig tells the story of a doll coming to life, with as much intellect and emotion that's needed.Barbie is unabashedly feminist, will ruffle some feathers (as it should), and will delight even more people. Themes of existentialism, individualism and masculinity are also dealt with.Despite being a product of Mattel, Greta found a way to critique the parent company (although it's funny that the product that mocks the maker ends up raking in more money for the maker).Margot Robbie is Barbie! She was an agreeable canvas, and she allowed Greta Gerwig to paint a very nuanced portrayal of Barbie. Ryan Gosling turns out a career-best performance in Barbie, stealing and shining in all of his scenes. The supporting cast also gives great performances.The soundtrack was fitting, guiding the movie down to the finish line with Billie Eilish's 'What was I made for' delivering a wonderful culmination. The set design and costumes were brilliant too.The lore of Barbie spans over six decades, so compressing it all into one movie was a definite challenge, but Greta was able to bring the most important things (including Easter eggs and fan service) to the movie.Barbie does have its failings, and the most noticeable is the plot. The first half is very intriguing, quirky and pays homage to other movies, but the second half isn't as tight.Barbie isn't perfect but it's a beautiful dose of everything good.8/10.",movi summer,barbiedazzl heartfelt brilliantli funni comedi year movi summerbarbi beauti blend comedi heart aid deftli colour visual greta gerwig tell stori doll come life much intellect emot that neededbarbi unabashedli feminist ruffl feather delight even peopl theme existenti individu masculin also dealt withdespit product mattel greta found way critiqu parent compani although funni product mock maker end rake money makermargot robbi barbi she agreeabl canva allow greta gerwig paint nuanc portray barbi ryan gosl turn careerbest perform barbi steal shine scene the support cast also give great performancesth soundtrack fit guid movi finish line billi eilish what i made deliv wonder culmin the set design costum brilliant tooth lore barbi span six decad compress one movi definit challeng greta abl bring import thing includ easter egg fan servic moviebarbi fail notic plot the first half intrigu quirki pay homag movi second half isnt tightbarbi isnt perfect beauti dose everyth good
Worth Watching for the Visuals & the Conversation,"Almost everyone should watch this movie, if for no other reason, to be part of the conversation. The topic of this movie often comes up in conversation and it is impossible to adequately summarize or explain the movie to anyone who has not seen it. ""The world of fantasy and make believe meets reality"" is not a unique narrative device but this film is unique in its approach to gender and unique in how it turns the ""Barbie"" stereotype on its head.Career driven women have often mocked the Barbie stereotype. Others have expressed contempt for it. The movie makes the point that in Barbie land, women can do anything and Ken is merely an accessory.As stereotypical Barbie (perfectly played by Margot Robbie) enters the portal to the real world (driving her Barbie mobile with Ken tagging along), Ken quickly realizes that men are in charge in the real world. Ken then promotes his naive understanding of ""stereotypical patriarchy"" which initially empowers him in a way he has never experienced in Barbie land.Ultimately, there is a clash of worlds, with once high powered Barbies (like ""President Barbie"") becoming accessories and merely ornamental in the patriarchy established by Ken in what becomes ""Kendom."" These Barbies claim that being ornamental is fun and are diagnosed by ""Weird Barbie"" (the Barbie who was played with too much, played by Kate McKinnon) as being ""brainwashed. The human females, Weird Barbie & stereotypical Barbie set out to restore Barbieland to its former glory by taking the power back from the Kens who are portrayed as less intelligent than the Barbies. Ultimately, stereotypical Barbie and the humans realize that gender roles are complicated and that what matters is that everyone is true to herself. They also realize that the Kens should also be free to define themselves- not just in relation to the Barbies.There appears to be an effort to acknowledge that men and women do not have to be in conflict with each other and that life is messy.The set, the colors, the Barbie references are all worth watching. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are perfectly cast. There are some funny lines and scenarios. I appreciated the perspective of Barbie who can do anything in a world where women rule in contrast to the modern criticism of Barbie as representing a female stereotype which damages young girls. Ultimately, it was not clear to me what message the film was attempting to promote. Certainly, there have been plenty of films where the men were the smarter, more interesting characters so perhaps, this film aimed to balance that out. There is also an acknowledgment that life is complicated and that we should love and respect each other.",worth watch visual convers,almost everyon watch movi reason part convers the topic movi often come convers imposs adequ summar explain movi anyon seen the world fantasi make believ meet realiti uniqu narr devic film uniqu approach gender uniqu turn barbi stereotyp headcar driven woman often mock barbi stereotyp other express contempt the movi make point barbi land woman anyth ken mere accessorya stereotyp barbi perfectli play margot robbi enter portal real world drive barbi mobil ken tag along ken quickli realiz men charg real world ken promot naiv understand stereotyp patriarchi initi empow way never experienc barbi landultim clash world high power barbi like presid barbi becom accessori mere ornament patriarchi establish ken becom kendom these barbi claim ornament fun diagnos weird barbi barbi play much play kate mckinnon brainwash the human femal weird barbi stereotyp barbi set restor barbieland former glori take power back ken portray le intellig barbi ultim stereotyp barbi human realiz gender role complic matter everyon true they also realiz ken also free defin relat barbiesther appear effort acknowledg men woman conflict life messyth set color barbi refer worth watch margot robbi ryan gosl perfectli cast there funni line scenario i appreci perspect barbi anyth world woman rule contrast modern critic barbi repres femal stereotyp damag young girl ultim clear messag film attempt promot certainli plenti film men smarter interest charact perhap film aim balanc there also acknowledg life complic love respect

The story line is just not it on top of all the actors are at least in late 30's to 40 ratio ( good for them ) but just not a great Barbie movie . Also when they mentioned death ??!? Like what in the world ? This is not my Barbie. They were better off taking Barbie from toy story and giving her and ken their own movie . Now that would be pretty cool . This live action was horrible. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Pandering, self-aware, overacted. I don't know which part of this was even close to hilarious. Will Farrell is lame not funny and this movie felt more like someone disguising a lecture into a movie. Ok we get equality and all that.

So perfectly casted,I'm so happy with the casting that I can look past some other issues. It wasn't as nostalgic as I would have wanted it to be but this is definitely a new generations barbie movie. It really checked all the boxes with me. Fun costumes and great performances. It was fantasy and also very real. I can't think of anyone that could ever be better as Barbie than Margot Robbie. This was the perfects storm and it was a long time coming. Greta Gerwig's directing was fun and the script was inspiring. This movie won't be for everyone for sure but as a long time barbie fan I'm pleased. They left the movie in the perfect place and I don't need more.

One of the most real and complex movies I've seen.,"Every one - man and woman, should watch this movie with an open-mind and introspection about current society. Barbie was one of the most real, complex, insightful, trippiest, thoughtful, and educational videos I've watched in a long time. This movie is not for everyone and is definitely not designed for kids due to the much deeper meaning. To get the full experience of the art of the movie, you have to ready to focus and peel all the symbolic layers.I came in expecting a lighthearted, fun, and silly movie like how you expect the stereotypical Barbie brand.

"Not made for the likes of me, but I enjoyed it.","The cinematography is eye watering (literally, you may need sun glasses?). Pinks and blues have never looked pinkier or bluier, yellows are more yellowy than a yellow thing. To such an extent that when it goes on to the real world scenes, it makes you kind of disappointed as to how bland everyday reality can be. Inevitably there is a lot of green screen effects, which is still not perfect despite modern day digital wizadry. But thats nit picking, this is a feast for the eyes ( Margot Robbie included..damn! Just objectified, did I learn nothing from this movie?).As expected the soundtrack throbbed along with some good upbeat and downbeat tracks, though it all sounded kind of safe, with nothing to really get the heart pumping, IMO.Plot and script were engaging enough, though there could have been a bit more jeapordy, or maybe a real villain to booo and hisss at ( a big orange idiot of a character maybe?). Yes it turns a tad preachy at times, and those of a certain political viewpoint may roll their eyes or huff and puff a bit. But there are learning lessons and points of recognition for most I imagine?I am not the target audience, but enjoyed it nontheless.",not made like i enjoy,the cinematographi eye water liter may need sun glass pink blue never look pinkier bluier yellow yellowi yellow thing to extent goe real world scene make kind disappoint bland everyday realiti inevit lot green screen effect still perfect despit modern day digit wizadri but that nit pick feast eye margot robbi includeddamn just objectifi i learn noth moviea expect soundtrack throb along good upbeat downbeat track though sound kind safe noth realli get heart pump imoplot script engag enough though could bit jeapordi mayb real villain booo hiss big orang idiot charact mayb ye turn tad preachi time certain polit viewpoint may roll eye huff puff bit but learn lesson point recognit i imaginei target audienc enjoy nontheless
Worth the wait,"If Barbie could've done anything with this movie, this is the best it could've done. Pulled off with comedy, heart, and emotion, Barbie delivers.Cast is great. No questions asked. I loved some of the smaller cameos in this film, definitely made the movie more appealing.Humor is back and forth in this movie, and all the jokes will keep you chuckling. I had some people laughing louder than the movie itself to some of these jokes. Props to you, Gerwig.Emotion is heavily involved in the third act of the film, and definitely changes tone. The ending takes sort of a twist, but is a good way to end the film.Overall, the film is great. Highly recommend seeing. Some of the jokes are more adult, so maybe think twice before taking your kid to see this. If you don't have kids, go see this. It'll be worth your money.",worth wait,if barbi couldv done anyth movi best couldv done pull comedi heart emot barbi deliverscast great no question ask i love smaller cameo film definit made movi appealinghumor back forth movi joke keep chuckl i peopl laugh louder movi joke prop gerwigemot heavili involv third act film definit chang tone the end take sort twist good way end filmoveral film great highli recommend see some joke adult mayb think twice take kid see if dont kid go see itll worth money
"""Barbie: A Whimsical Journey of Self-Discovery""","""Barbie"" is a film that left me with mixed feelings. While it had its strengths, like Ryan Gosling's exceptional performance and emotionally impactful scenes, I found the film to be a bit overloaded with messages. Some parts were polarizing, and the humor occasionally missed the mark.Spoiler alert: The film's message about embracing uncertainty and self-discovery was commendable, but the execution sometimes seemed confusing. The protagonist's journey towards self-acceptance could have led her to a simple job, symbolizing personal growth. Instead, the choice to visit a gynecologist seemed a little too on the nose.One standout aspect was the beautiful message conveyed through Billie's song, which added an exquisite touch to the film. Overall, I'd rate ""Barbie"" 7/10 stars for its strong performances and emotional moments, but it could have benefited from a more focused approach to its messages.",barbi a whimsic journey selfdiscoveri,barbi film left mix feel while strength like ryan gosl except perform emot impact scene i found film bit overload messag some part polar humor occasion miss markspoil alert the film messag embrac uncertainti selfdiscoveri commend execut sometim seem confus the protagonist journey toward selfaccept could led simpl job symbol person growth instead choic visit gynecologist seem littl noseon standout aspect beauti messag convey billi song ad exquisit touch film overal id rate barbi star strong perform emot moment could benefit focus approach messag
Boring and predictable,"Ignoring all the controversies and looking at this just as a movie, the overall feeling I had while wathcing it was sheer boredeom.

There was nothing much to do for actors as all are cartoonish.The social commentary had no subtelty and just tried to hit you hard with the messaging with no deep insight or thought put in.The set design in Barbieland is the only saving grace in this move and also the iconic opening score insipred by 2001 A Space Odyssey!Hats off to the marketing team for this movie, who made sure that everone was talking about it and sustained the interest.",bore predict,ignor controversi look movi overal feel i wathc sheer boredeom everi singl dialogu scene predict even song humor fell flat time there noth much actor cartoonishth social commentari subtelti tri hit hard messag deep insight thought put inth set design barbieland save grace move also icon open score insipr a space odysseyhat market team movi made sure everon talk sustain interest
A movie that made me proud to be a women,"This movie is not only lighthearted but a way of exploring how women are seen within society. To Barbie she views herself as someone that strives to be able to do anything a man could do and to her she thought that mirrored to the real world. The movie fights against the double standards women have themselves and about understanding yourself as an individual. To me, the most touching part was the end when it shows clips of women just laughing and enjoying themselves and I felt it had such a deep message to be proud that I am a woman. It also referenced how just because toy Ken is an accessory to Barbie that doesn't have to be his only personality trait which I believed showed a great way of presenting the film was not only about women's explorations and feelings but men's as well.",a movi made proud woman,thi movi lightheart way explor woman seen within societi to barbi view someon strive abl anyth man could thought mirror real world the movi fight doubl standard woman understand individu to touch part end show clip woman laugh enjoy i felt deep messag proud i woman it also referenc toy ken accessori barbi doesnt person trait i believ show great way present film woman explor feel men well
Unexpected but... not?,"I enjoyed this film. I cried at the ending and I laughed out loud at some parts, which is something not many films can actually do to me. I LOVED the visuals - it felt exactly like Barbie should feel to look at, and I love how the film never seems to take itself too seriously, which again, is what I expect from a film about a Barbie doll.Having said that, there were a few things I questioned. I'm not the target audience (being a 17 year old guy), but also... who WAS the target audience? It feels like it should be for kids, but it was far too existential for that, especially at the end, and some of the jokes were just blatantly sexual. Was it for people who used to own Barbies as a kid? It was still enjoyable, but I wouldn't recommend it for small children or even children at all, really.I feel like I have to be careful saying this, but the message of the film was a bit over the top. I understand it and I liked that it was there, but it felt a bit crammed down our throats. It almost feels like a caricature of our own world at times. The real world sucks, but the divide between men and women isn't THAT pronounced - not all men are incompetent, macho freaks who have everything handed to them on a silver platter, and not all women are suppressed as intensely as the film seems to suggest. Still, it was a good message and made me emotional at points, and it was still a fun film experience, albeit not what I was expecting.",unexpect,i enjoy film i cri end i laugh loud part someth mani film actual i love visual felt exactli like barbi feel look i love film never seem take serious i expect film barbi dollhav said thing i question im target audienc year old guy also wa target audienc it feel like kid far existenti especi end joke blatantli sexual wa peopl use barbi kid it still enjoy i wouldnt recommend small child even child reallyi feel like i care say messag film bit top i understand i like felt bit cram throat it almost feel like caricatur world time the real world suck divid men woman isnt that pronounc men incompet macho freak everyth hand silver platter woman suppress intens film seem suggest still good messag made emot point still fun film experi albeit i expect
"great actors, weak plot","Great actors - except for the young girl, who seemed confused on how to act, but maybe she was just lacking being directed well.Too much confusion in the plot - the whole death theme did not make sense in a movie about the dynamics between men and women. Some films can take on multiple themes, but for this one trying to (unsuccessfully) tackle that second death theme took away from the main theme.Also, why did the girl's mom have a token husband? Either she should have no husband at all (was that too radical for a Disney-like movie?) or he shoud have been a functional character. Also, all this turning back and forth between the two worlds is tiring. Movie should be cleaned up.",great actor weak plot,great actor except young girl seem confus act mayb lack direct welltoo much confus plot whole death theme make sen movi dynam men woman some film take multipl theme one tri unsuccess tackl second death theme took away main themealso girl mom token husband either husband radic disneylik movi shoud function charact also turn back forth two world tire movi clean

The Lego Movie but for females,Now please take into consideration that I am a man. And a white man at that.Barbie was much better than I thought it was going to be. I'm just going to get into what I didn't like. Barbie starts off as a fun light hearted comedy movie. The first 30 mins are great! From then on the movie begins to have an identity crisis. It goes from deep feminist themes to a car commercial to a slide show to a 4th wall break depression Barbie ad and then a musical. One of my biggest problems was that I felt like the movie was talking to the audience too much. Things were being said or done visually in the movie not for the sake of the story but for the audience. Which maybe some people like but to me it kinda took me out of the experience.Barbie wanted to be taken seriously but because of its inability to be consistent and justify the actions of certain characters and events it left the audience behind.Like what is the purpose of Mr. Buisness(Will Ferrall)? Is he good? Is he evil? Does he care? Does he just want money? Why does he ask like a Barbie but he's from the real world?At the end of the day I agree with a lot of what was being said and the themes that were built. I just don't think the movie is for me... at all.

Where do I begin? The movie has a lot on its mind but is also very entertaining.,"First, a disclaimer - although I know what a Barbie doll is, I had never played with one; I am a baby-boomer and by the time Barbie dolls came out, I was in a very socially aware environment - hence the classic Barbie stick figure, with all her accessories, was judged as unhealthy for young girls in a variety of categories - creating a negative self-image, fostering excessive commercialism, etc. By the time the diverse Barbies were coming out I no longer paid any attention to dolls. But I'd heard good things about the movie, and been reassured that you don't need to know much about Barbie to enjoy it, so I did watch it.I was pretty much grabbed by it from the opening scene and continued to be impressed throughout by the clever plot and dialogue, the staging, and the perfect casting and acting. THIS MAY BE A SPOILER As it turns out it delivers lectures about gender stereotyping, about finding oneself, and other deep themes, while at the same time hilariously engaging in it. It is funny in parts, yet also very serious and even moving. It seems surreal at times, and over-the-top - and seemed to borrow from Busby Berkeley musicals and Monty Python (and who knows what else.:)) The horseback riding with no horses reminded me a scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail in which the king trotted along while lackeys banged coconuts together to sound like the clomping of hooves. Despite being utterly nonsensical and unrealistic, it somehow all worked, and on so many levels.

"Empowering, loving and a must watch","To be fully honest, I had initial doubts and a lack of interest in seeing this film. It didn't seem like something I would enjoy.To my surprise, I was touched. Barbie is so empowering and Greta Gerwig truly outdid herself with the cast, sets, feel of the film as well as all the little details that made the scenes come together to create a beautiful story.The bright colours of the sets and wardrobe really made the movie what it is..alive and full of warmth, compassion and encouragement. The WOMEN EMPOWERMENT in this film is like no other as it really does capture what Barbie is all about.The dolls children play with have a much deeper value than I ever thought possible as one can truly be anything with Barbie. There are so many little details in the film that made this come alive.Barbie is an incredible film, touching and empowering, loving and brave. I am so proud to be a women and this film has only strengthened that self respect and love.I truly believe this film can change so many view points on various topics and am excited to see where this brings society.Thank you, Barbie <3.",empow love must watch,to fulli honest i initi doubt lack interest see film it didnt seem like someth i would enjoyto surpris i touch barbi empow greta gerwig truli outdid cast set feel film well littl detail made scene come togeth creat beauti storyth bright colour set wardrob realli made movi isal full warmth compass encourag the woman empower film like realli captur barbi aboutth doll child play much deeper valu i ever thought possibl one truli anyth barbi there mani littl detail film made come alivebarbi incred film touch empow love brave i proud woman film strengthen self respect lovei truli believ film chang mani view point variou topic excit see bring societythank barbi
"Fab and Fun, Kenough","This was a great movie for the type that it is. Yes, is cheeky / cheesy/ over the top. It's also heart warming, fun, and really original. I loved the way that the movie hit the nail on the head about the complexity of being female, young or old. It truly was a reflection of how so many of us have been made to feel. They also got some laughs over play on words or specific movements made by the actors and actresses because it was just so real and true to the way we all played as children. The casting of MR as Barbie and RG as Ken were such perfect choices. The kids liked it and so did us 30 somethings. Perfect balance of nostalgia and today.

Preaching not required...,"I thought the first half of the movie was quite humorous, taking the Mickey out of the whole Barbie phenomenon that it is.Great colour and cinematography and I even laughed in some parts. Then something strange happened about half way through: it got all serious and made Ken a baddie and then decided to preach to us about the injustices that women have endured (which I agree to be true, but didn't fit where I thought this movie was going).Not quite sure who this movie was intended for, but I walked out disappointed. The males all ended up being either bad or stupid, or both.

Just a Kitsch...,"Barbie movie was very under my expectations.The movie per total was a kitsch... from beggining to the end.I expected a more interesting story, perhaps with some decent lines of comedy.The regisor didn't had a vision, she just hurry up to create a piece of something, just to be there in cinemas to gather money.The regisor just took advantage of the big name and popularity of Barbie toy.Mains actors were blunt.

Well deserving of the hype,"This is the first time I've written a review for a movie, that should tell you that I enjoyed this movie an awful lot.The storyline grabbed my attention at every corner and the soundtrack continues to ring in my ears and evoke a feeling of confidence in myself and pure joy. It really focused in on it's female audience and was able to accurately portray the modern day plight of the average woman. I didn't expect to cry during this movie but I had never felt so understood and empowered to be myself.Margot Robbie was Barbie, she managed to uphold the whimsy and joy of Barbie throughout the tough political statements that with any other actress would have depressed the audience. Ryan Gosling never failed to make me laugh in his role as Ken, he was perfect for this role and I can't imagine anyone else fulfilling it to the same standard. The supporting Barbies and Kens also excelled in their roles adding to the character and world of Barbie.I have spent some time reading other reviews which have complained that the 3rd portion of the movie was too heavy handed in its feminist perspective and that its blunt political message didn't properly encapsulate Barbie. To that I say; The 3rd portion is less than 40 minutes long, if you can't listen to women's issues for that little time without getting bored then maybe you're not getting what we're saying. And this movie was actually about Barbie, unlike the animated Barbie movies which merely starred Barbie. This movie is actually about Barbie and her extensive history as a controversial doll that had to fight tooth and nail to make it into the hands of little girls and inspire them to be more than mothers.Overall, Barbie was incredible and I hope she inspires even more little girls through this movie than she already has.",well deserv hype,thi first time ive written review movi tell i enjoy movi aw lotth storylin grab attent everi corner soundtrack continu ring ear evok feel confid pure joy it realli focus femal audienc abl accur portray modern day plight averag woman i didnt expect cri movi i never felt understood empow myselfmargot robbi barbi manag uphold whimsi joy barbi throughout tough polit statement actress would depress audienc ryan gosl never fail make laugh role ken perfect role i cant imagin anyon el fulfil standard the support barbi ken also excel role ad charact world barbiei spent time read review complain rd portion movi heavi hand feminist perspect blunt polit messag didnt properli encapsul barbi to i say the rd portion le minut long cant listen woman issu littl time without get bore mayb your get say and movi actual barbi unlik anim barbi movi mere star barbi thi movi actual barbi extens histori controversi doll fight tooth nail make hand littl girl inspir mothersoveral barbi incred i hope inspir even littl girl movi alreadi
"The Little Mermaid meets Pleasantville, the Musical","I can honestly say that ""Barbie"" is one of those movies where you either completely love it or hate it. Either way, there seems to be very little gray matter - and it's the type of film where you simply sit back and enjoy the ride. As a former Barbie connoisseur now in her 40's, I was curious how producers would carry this film. And since nothing is completely original now, I couldn't ignore the overtones similar to 1998's Pleasantville - with our female protagonist postulating the human world outside of ""Barbieland"". Alas, toward the third act, the movie seemed to whip into a full-fledged ""Mama Mia"" production and I wondered amusingly what the hell I was watching at times. There were parts that were downright silly (Ryan Gosling's performance as Ken was hilarious, but borderline over-the-top, to say the least). However, the profound messages of diversity, female empowerment, personal acceptance and loving thyself were ubiquitous (I mean, they REALLY stressed it from start to finish), and little girls across the globe should find the movie worthy of embracing. For us middle-aged moms, you'll delight in several heartfelt chuckles...not to mention the wonderful tie-ins to discontinued Barbies from our past.

Makes you think,"The movie is great. Everyone says it's very preachy but I actually think the societal expose is done in a very tasteful manner. It makes you think about the world we live in and points out ridiculous things that have always been there but we never paid attention to - for example, why most cash has famous men on them, and not one woman (with some exceptions around the world, of course).

Fun but unnecessarily bitter and divisive,"This film has hilarious moments and it visually looks good with the set, costume, and prop designs. HOWEVER, the film shoves its agendas down our throats like it's thanksgiving dinner.The marketing team played it off as just a fun, harmless, self-aware comedy but the end result is this cake full of feminism, mockery of the entire male species, outright preachy at times and covered in icing of a colorful fun experience.The movie contrasts Barbieland as female-dominated/controlling with men to the sidelines who just are just there to wave at barbie or something. Likewise, in the real world, men control everything and women are just there to look pretty and clean and stuff. The film shows half the human population (the men) as utterly and irredeemably horrible.And by the end you would assume they would compromise and have equal power and respect and everyone would see the value of men and women being both pretty awesome and that they should work together as a team? Nope! The Kens just wither back to the sidelines to their depressing selves while the Barbies go back to their girl-power or ruling everything without thinking twice about it. It feels like they almost had a good ending, but simply just couldn't help themselves.In front of where me and my friends were sitting was this mom and her two daughters who seemed around 5 and 7 and that poor little girl was squirming in her seat and asking ""Is it almost over?"" multiple times to her mom who was trying to quiet her down during another preachy scene.

Actually Supports Men and Women,"This movie is an intelligence test. I saw many comments how people're describing the movie attacks men. It actually doesn't. I am a man, maybe even a stereotypical one - I loved Sigma Ken part, it was hilarious. I have a degree in Economics and love to work out in the gym, watching action movies, dark jokes, drink not cheap beers...I believe the movie told a full of heart story how both sides (men and women) should team work more! The story perfectly told in a satirical way explains in what areas we all struggle. I won't go deep dive in because my short review doesn't contain any spoilers but trust me, the movie tries to be supportive and share a thoughtful and warm message in a fun way. It isn't woke, it doesn't treat the audience like a dumbass, it doesn't tokenise anybody, it doesn't force anything. It represents people lost in the world, trying to find their place and I think it says: Chill out.Don't be mad. Go there with open heart and mind and have fun because I did.

"Beautifully performed, but little charm","Yet I loved the performances from both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, and the incredible aspects of feminism and battling misogyny, I felt untouched by the film at some points. Mainly most of the characters in the 'Real World' - For example; Will Ferrell's character was completely useless and didn't add much to the film as a whole, and DEAR GOD did Connor Swindells contribute absolutely nothing to this film. Personally it got to the point where I felt as if this film should've just been a biopic about Ruth Handler, plus Rhea Perlman's performance as Ruth Handler was just exciting and very heartfelt/heartwarming at the same time.Just overall, Most aspects of the film I did enjoy, it was just little things here and there, useless characters, messy writing and dialogue and the ""joke"" about Zack Snyder's Justice League didn't sit well with me.I will say I did like this film, I just didn't LOVE it.",beauti perform littl charm,yet i love perform margot robbi ryan gosl incred aspect femin battl misogyni i felt untouch film point mainli charact real world for exampl will ferrel charact complet useless didnt add much film whole dear god connor swindel contribut absolut noth film person got point i felt film shouldv biopic ruth handler plu rhea perlman perform ruth handler excit heartfeltheartwarm timejust overal most aspect film i enjoy littl thing useless charact messi write dialogu joke zack snyder justic leagu didnt sit well mei say i like film i didnt love

She is the main reason I decided to watch this movie. The second reason being this film is talked about everywhere I go. I had very high expectations based on how much it's been hyped up, but unfortunately the movie fell flat in my opinion. I think if I had a tween daughter or neice then I would have loved to take her on a night out to see this movie. The Barbie set was nostalgic and so adorable, but the storyline really fell flat for me. I expected a story with a lot of meaning behind it and although some parts were great like when Barbie tells the elderly woman she's beautiful (Ugh! That pulled at my heart strings big time) and the part when America explained the things expected of women as she started de-programming the brainwashed Barbie dolls and lastly when Barbie told Ken it's not his girlfriend or his car that defines him.... those 5 minute scenes were honestly the best things about the movie. I wanted more of those or at least more depth to the storyline. Whether that be more of a connection between Barbie and her human or Barbie spending more time in the real world.

For all those gingerly skirting around an existential crisis,"This movie touches on complex themes the way the Truman show and West World were able to do but in a way that was more glittery and a bit more superficial. Because it juxtaposes a world that was created in the imagination of women (Barbieland) vs. Men (the real world), it has a bit of a devastating conclusion for both: mainly that people struggle to live up to ideals, resulting in feelings of alienation and depression that they try to hide. What I appreciated so much about the movie was its commentary on men feeling like they need a ""Barbie"" at their side to feel successful. It occurred in Barbieland but honestly it was a commentary on both men and women who feel that way in both worlds. It's easier to think that someone else will help us determine why we are here instead of really exploring who we are and what our purpose is as individuals. There's a loneliness that rung so true at the heart of the Ken experience. Curious what men thought of it and if they could relate.Set design and visual humor were awesome. Everyone played their role with a lot of heart. My soon to be 11 year old daughter loved it as well. It was just wonderfully entertaining.",for gingerli skirt around existenti crisi,thi movi touch complex theme way truman show west world abl way glitteri bit superfici becaus juxtapos world creat imagin woman barbieland v men real world bit devast conclus mainli peopl struggl live ideal result feel alien depress tri hide what i appreci much movi commentari men feel like need barbi side feel success it occur barbieland honestli commentari men woman feel way world it easier think someon el help u determin instead realli explor purpos individu there loneli rung true heart ken experi curiou men thought could relateset design visual humor awesom everyon play role lot heart my soon year old daughter love well it wonder entertain

Heavy duty marketing,"The movie was very good. It had comic moments, impeccable costumes and exceptional acting, as well as necessary political dialogues. However, despite these strengths, the ending was disjointed and poorly crafted, leaving a sense of dissatisfaction. It felt like the filmmakers were struggling to find a cohesive resolution, resulting in a lackluster conclusion that did not do justice to the well-crafted narrative. While the movie has its merits, the disappointing ending prevents me from considering watching it again.

Cotton candy feminism in support of a brand,"It's a satiric fantasy comedy based on the Barbie doll created in 1959. The film is set in a fantasy ""Barbieland"" and Southern California in the modern age.There are multiple Barbies and multiple Kens. Margot Robbie, Kate McKinnon, and Issa Rae are the most important Barbies. The most recognizable Kens are Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu. The plot, such as it is, initially features Stereotypical Barbie (Robbie) in a matriarchal Barbieland where Kens struggle for relevance and autonomy. However, Barbie begins to channel aspects of the ""real world"" of her original owner, and Weird Barbie (McKinnon) sends her to Southern California to engage her human connection. There she meets Gloria (America Ferrera) and her daughter, Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt). Barbie also encounters CEO (Will Ferrell) and Ruth (Rhea Perlman), the inventor of the Barbie doll.The film follows the adventures of Barbie (Robbie) and Ken (Gosling) in California and their response to the patriarchy they find in the real world. This patriarchy has implications for life in Barbieland when they return. Everything happily resolves in the end.I was frankly disappointed. There were genuinely amusing spots, but not the laugh-out-loud sequences mentioned by some reviewers. Robbie and Gosling are good with a thin script.

Barbie was much more than expected,"Barbie was an extremely fun movie that was entertaining and funny throughout the entire runtime of the movie. The jokes were witty, funny, well-written and did not impede on the tone of any serious moments. Barbie was for sure targeted for kids but made for adults to enjoy just as much as the little ones. The casting was phenomenal, every actor embodied their character, Margot Robbie is dynamite in her role delivering every line with sincerity and real feeling. Ryan Gosling was the epitome of Ken, fun, and lovable but he was also able to sublimely deliver emotions that one would not associate with Ken. With 2 powerful stars you would think that the secondary characters would be unnoteworthy, but Simu Liu, and Will Ferrell command the screen so remarkably, not to mention every other Barbie and Ken, and Allen too. All of this without even mention the cinematography and the breathtaking music which culminates into a delightful story that impressively tackles pretty serious issues.",barbi much expect,barbi extrem fun movi entertain funni throughout entir runtim movi the joke witti funni wellwritten imped tone seriou moment barbi sure target kid made adult enjoy much littl one the cast phenomen everi actor embodi charact margot robbi dynamit role deliv everi line sincer real feel ryan gosl epitom ken fun lovabl also abl sublim deliv emot one would associ ken with power star would think secondari charact would unnoteworthi simu liu will ferrel command screen remark mention everi barbi ken allen all without even mention cinematographi breathtak music culmin delight stori impress tackl pretti seriou issu
incredible costuming but...,"I have questions: when the kens take over Barbie land, they see the Barbies as just accessories but then when the Barbies just swap places every ken still had a Barbie why would they even care as long as they still have a pretty thing listening? I just feel like that scene was kind of random and odd I guess. I still enjoy the film overall it was very visually appealing. Will ferrells character was just cheap laughs, nothing new for him. He's too childlike to believe he intends any ill will for barbie so it really takes the wind out of the movies sails. Also the parallels between this and don't worry darling and they have the same flaw in my opinion. An unclear driving force of why this is happening now - randomly thinking about death? I would have preferred to have seen her be picked up in the real world and then the reveal that it was gloria and not the daughter could have been a more significant moment and they could have fleshed out Gloria's yearning for girlhood more and why she played with the dolls.",incred costum,i question ken take barbi land see barbi accessori barbi swap place everi ken still barbi would even care long still pretti thing listen i feel like scene kind random odd i guess i still enjoy film overal visual appeal will ferrel charact cheap laugh noth new he childlik believ intend ill barbi realli take wind movi sail also parallel dont worri darl flaw opinion an unclear drive forc happen randomli think death i would prefer seen pick real world reveal gloria daughter could signific moment could flesh gloria yearn girlhood play doll
"Wow, beautiful execution","This movie represents in such a beautiful way what it is like to be a woman, and the grief we might feel growing up as one. I was so incredibly touched.Margo's acting was excellent and she is the perfect fit for Barbie.As well as Ryan. Perfect casting.I genuinely felt overflowing with love for women and felt the need to hug or hold hands with those around me.This movie did an excellent job making us women feel seen, not only as the 'girl boss' and other outdated feminist catchphrases, but also as the depth we have, and the devastating grief we feel when growing up as little girls into a world that wasn't as sympathetic as we initially thought it would be. Unfortunately it is mainly because of men and the patriarchy..
The thing with these type of movies is that a woman's perspective and a man's perspective are completely different.. most women I know that watched the movie felt as I did - love, grief, touched and understood.The men that have watched the movie did love it as well (and some hated it because of toxic masculinity) but most of them weren't touched. And I think that made me a little heartbroken..
Other than that - it's truly is a feminist masterpiece.I will definitely will be watching again.",wow beauti execut,thi movi repres beauti way like woman grief might feel grow one i incred touchedmargo act excel perfect fit barbiea well ryan perfect castingi genuin felt overflow love woman felt need hug hold hand around methi movi excel job make u woman feel seen girl bos outdat feminist catchphras also depth devast grief feel grow littl girl world wasnt sympathet initi thought would unfortun mainli men patriarchi the thing type movi woman perspect man perspect complet differ woman i know watch movi felt i love grief touch understoodth men watch movi love well hate toxic masculin werent touch and i think made littl heartbroken other truli feminist masterpiecei definit watch

Wonderful,"Didn't really know what to expect from this, but this is one of the best films of the year. Laugh-out-loud funny and heartfelt, Margot and Ryan Gosling throw themselves head first into Barbie and Ken like some kind of Zoolander/Legally Blonde/Lego Movie hybrid, but far more intelligently written.Jam packed with in-jokes, sly references and even a Mattel-censored F-bomb, Barbie is relentlessly entertaining from start to finish. Most of the satire will fly over kids' heads, as we had a theatre-full of Belgrave's finest letting their vile offspring literally run riot under the screen.Luckily, the movie was so good we kept our teacher voices to ourselves.

Good but too much,"So, I just wanna say that I was very hyped for this movie. But after I watched this, I was a bit disappointed.The movie has a lot of cringe scenes. One of them are funny too, but at some point this is just cringe and too much.About the message of this movie, I agree with it and i like it because in our world women are really disrespected, harassed and so on, but at some point it was too much. I say this as a male, but one of my friends, who is a girl, has the same opinion. But the other one, with the mom and the teenager rebonding, that was amazing.The sound tracks are really good tho. To include artists like Nicki Minaj, Ice Spice, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish and so on is a great move to make this film an iconic one.The cast is great and I think Margot Robbie played Barbie perfectly with her acting and her appearance too.In conclusion, I recommend this movie because I think this is a film that anyone has to watch because it's a Barbie one, and it can also teach teenagers a lesson, despite the cringe scenes.",good much,so i wan na say i hype movi but i watch i bit disappointedth movi lot cring scene one funni point cring muchabout messag movi i agre like world woman realli disrespect harass point much i say male one friend girl opinion but one mom teenag rebond amazingth sound track realli good tho to includ artist like nicki minaj ice spice dua lipa billi eilish great move make film icon oneth cast great i think margot robbi play barbi perfectli act appear tooin conclus i recommend movi i think film anyon watch barbi one also teach teenag lesson despit cring scene
Not family friendly or really enjoyable,"I expected this movie to be more lighthearted and it had heavy themes and material. The first half hour or so was ok and had some funny moments but the second half just wasn't enjoyable to me. The writing was not good story telling and felt more like a number of speeches. I found it hard to watch honestly.There was a lot of overt messaging that I feel was not suitable for this movie. I didn't appreciate the depiction of the relationship between Ken and Barbie or the situation created for them.

Perfection,"Wow is all I can say. So many layers that had my daughter and I smiling, laughing, and sobbing all at the same time. Absolute perfection. So brilliantly written. Everyone should see this movie. It was amazing!!! Aspects for generations of women to submerge themselves in and was also full of a beautiful nostalgia for all the little girls inside of us, and those still growing up. I can not say enough good things about this movie. Though some may not enjoy the truths behind what this movie stands for it was a true testament to our current state of the world and what weve had to deal with for forever.

Like reading a textbook instead of a novel,"Making a Barbie movie about feminism is a cool idea. Having Barbie comment on the patriarchy just like Animal Farm about communism and Wall Street about capitalism. It's admirable and the message gets through.The problem is that the actual movie is so bad. Even though you buy in on the two worlds, etc, etc. In the end, it was like reading a textbook instead of a novel. Normally, the strengths with fables and allegories is that they are profound on many levels. Here, everything is spelled out from a a teacher's desk and the whole film comes across as bit thin.I would not watch this movie again.",like read textbook instead novel,make barbi movi femin cool idea have barbi comment patriarchi like anim farm commun wall street capit it admir messag get throughth problem actual movi bad even though buy two world etc etc in end like read textbook instead novel normal strength fabl allegori profound mani level here everyth spell teacher desk whole film come across bit thini would watch movi
Couldn't love it more,"This movie is nothing like I expected AND I LOVE IT. Greta strikes again with the best combo of comedy and drama. I laughed, I almost cried and it was just the best experience.Having moments when I just loved seeing the interpretation of the Barbie world, moments that shocked me of how well they described the patriarchy even through jokes, the moments showing the women maturing and growing up that almost made me cry. There was nothing I didn't love about this movie and I can't stress this enough.Overall, this movie made me fell more empowered and confident than ever and I wish that everyone could have the same experience that I did.",couldnt love,thi movi noth like i expect and i love it greta strike best combo comedi drama i laugh i almost cri best experiencehav moment i love see interpret barbi world moment shock well describ patriarchi even joke moment show woman matur grow almost made cri there noth i didnt love movi i cant stress enoughoveral movi made fell empow confid ever i wish everyon could experi i
The wait was worth it.,"It's hard to say this movie isn't great even if you don't agree with the third act feminism part. I mean, Margot Robbie nailed it! And Ryan Gosling... come on, i was expecting so much from him, and he was even better than i tought, so freaking funny and always on point! The set production and Costume design are, of course, oscar nominees already.Overall i liked the message, the social critic, the perfomances, the production, the jokes were very funny, the references... what's there not to like? Such an enjoyable movie. Perhaps the part played by America Ferrera required a most skilled actress to carry the emotive part of the movie and the monologue in a more convincing way, but that doesn't ruin the movie at all. I think it's a must watch for cinema lovers and for people who just wanna have a good time as well.",the wait worth,it hard say movi isnt great even dont agre third act femin part i mean margot robbi nail and ryan gosl come expect much even better tought freak funni alway point the set product costum design cours oscar nomine alreadyoveral like messag social critic perfom product joke funni refer what like such enjoy movi perhap part play america ferrera requir skill actress carri emot part movi monologu convinc way doesnt ruin movi i think must watch cinema lover peopl wan na good time well
More than just a children's Movie,"First, I'd like to clarify one thing: Barbie is not an ""Anti-Men"" or a ""Men-Hating"" Movie in any shape or form. Instead, it is a very thought-provoking exploration of contemporary ideas such as Identity, Self-discovery, Existentialism, Ethics, Feminism, Gender Roles, Consumerism, Materialism, Beauty and Body Image.Barbie feels like a satirical take on the real world, the world we live in.The opening scene of Barbie was very similar to the opening scene of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Then we get introduced to the Barbieland, the most perfect, ideal world according to the Barbies. Everyone's happy, everyone's joyful, and cheerful, and most importantly everything is being run by the Barbies. EVERYTHING. Ken is just a supporting character. There won't be a Ken with Barbie.But then things start to change, Barbie talks about DEATH. Mind you, nobody dies in Barbieland, they get discontinued by MATTEL. Then Barbie embarks on a journey of self-discovery accompanied by Ken.One of my favorite scenes is when Barbie and Ken are in the real world and both of them get catcalled. The stark contrast between the reaction of both Barbie and Ken to the catcalling was portrayed very accurately.Ken learns about Patriarchy in the real world. Ken used to live in a world where everything is run by Barbie but in the real, it's literally the opposite. Ken takes all he has learned in the real world back to Barbieland and changes everything. He literally changes Barbieland to ""Kendom Land"".Meanwhile, Barbie is trying to find answers to why she doesn't feel perfect anymore or why she doesn't feel pretty anymore.We get a glimpse of the Mattel Corporation as well and how literally every working person is like a doll.There is this one monologue in the film which stands out. The monologue which helped Barbie get out of her Existential Crisis.The last 15-20 minutes of the film are perfect, the set designing, the dialogues, everything - it was perfect.If you are someone who loves great films and enjoys great storytelling, you'll love Barbie.Give it a chance and you'll not regret it.",more child movi,first id like clarifi one thing barbi antimen menhat movi shape form instead thoughtprovok explor contemporari idea ident selfdiscoveri existenti ethic femin gender role consumer materi beauti bodi imagebarbi feel like satir take real world world live inth open scene barbi similar open scene stanley kubrick a space odyssey then get introduc barbieland perfect ideal world accord barbi everyon happi everyon joy cheer importantli everyth run barbi everyth ken support charact there wont ken barbiebut thing start chang barbi talk death mind nobodi die barbieland get discontinu mattel then barbi embark journey selfdiscoveri accompani kenon favorit scene barbi ken real world get catcal the stark contrast reaction barbi ken catcal portray accuratelyken learn patriarchi real world ken use live world everyth run barbi real liter opposit ken take learn real world back barbieland chang everyth he liter chang barbieland kendom landmeanwhil barbi tri find answer doesnt feel perfect anymor doesnt feel pretti anymorew get glimps mattel corpor well liter everi work person like dollther one monologu film stand the monologu help barbi get existenti crisisth last minut film perfect set design dialogu everyth perfectif someon love great film enjoy great storytel youll love barbieg chanc youll regret
Amusing,"My wife and I had heard a lot of mixed reviews of this movie, so we decided to watch it now that it isn't just a rental. The start of it was super corny but once Barbie went to the real world, it got a lot more interesting. As some have said, the social commentary was forced, but the movie wasn't trying to hide the fact it was hitting you over the head with it. I found it quite creative to have Barbies living in a land where they thought they had totally solved equal rights, but where in reality they had simply oppressed men. The commentary at the end allowed personal conclusions. Mine were that relationships are strongest when they are two ways, and that it is always a battle to keep things equal. Even the women at the end liked keeping the men a little oppressed.",amus,my wife i heard lot mix review movi decid watch isnt rental the start super corni barbi went real world got lot interest a said social commentari forc movi wasnt tri hide fact hit head i found quit creativ barbi live land thought total solv equal right realiti simpli oppress men the commentari end allow person conclus mine relationship strongest two way alway battl keep thing equal even woman end like keep men littl oppress
Oddly fantastic!,"The script is well-written with engaging complexity, a remarkable script that transformed into an excellent film. All of the castings are top tier, I can't imagine another Barbie other than Margot. The sounds and visuals are admittedly not too prominent, but it also contributes significantly to the emotional orientation, which was done nicely. However, the film could have done better in developing the supporting characters. It's truly amazing that a film like this could do so well at the box office compared to other billion-dollar movies. And I think I'm not the only one hoping that there won't be a sequel, it's much better standing alone.",oddli fantast,the script wellwritten engag complex remark script transform excel film all cast top tier i cant imagin anoth barbi margot the sound visual admittedli promin also contribut significantli emot orient done nice howev film could done better develop support charact it truli amaz film like could well box offic compar billiondollar movi and i think im one hope wont sequel much better stand alon
A mix of masterful and missed opportunity,"The 1968 picture Planet of the Apes reverses traditional roles. After time-travelling thousands of years into the future, astronaut Charlton Heston discovers a world where apes are the advanced primate, and humans their chattels.I hated the movie as a boy, in as good a way as it is possible to hate a film. Could it happen, I wondered, where humans could become inferior to another species? If it did, would we deserve it? The film haunted me enough at age 13 to ensure I have never dared rewatch it.The 2023 movie Barbie looks nothing like Planet of the Apes. Its cinematography is an exercise in high-octane kitsch, as unapologetically saccharine and unrealistic as the dolls it is designed to sell. Yet it too explores role reversal, here between sexes rather than species.Barbieland is a quasi-mirror image of Realworld, the film's moniker for present-day California. Barbieland is a gynocracy and a matriarchy. The Barbies, for they are multiple, live happy, fulfilled lives. They prosper at the top of every profession and public office. They never age, bodily imperfections are impossible, and life is a perpetual merry-go-round of choreographed parties, infinite outfit changes and enduring sisterhood. The men - the Kens - are decoration. They are unable to perform even basic functions: physical and sexual. They lack genitals. Their muscles are impressive but purely for show. They preen on the beach, but surfing is beyond them.One day, Classic Barbie (Margot Robbie) awakens to discover her pristine feet no longer arch perfectly into her high-heeled shoes. She no longer walks on immaculately pedicured tiptoes, but on flat, ordinary, soles, to the collective horror of her sisterhood.Robbie realises something is wrong, and - following a revelation from her compatriot Weird Barbie - sets out to Realworld to resolve it. Classic Ken (Ryan Gosling) stows away in her car. The duo eventually arrive in Santa Monica via a series of rose-tinted vehicles.It isn't long before Gosling discovers that Realworld is unlike Barbieworld. Here, the power is held by men. Gosling, surprised to be treated with respect, becomes fascinated with patriarchy, and quickly warms to the paradigm. For Robbie, the experience is the opposite. People mock her. Daily life is threatening, not fun. Her self-confidence warps into self-consciousness. Ken precedes her return to Barbieland, and quickly sets about transforming the pink paradise into Kendom, a toyish grotesque of Realworld, where the Kens are in charge, and the Barbies retained as ornamental servants.Much ensues. We race and chase SUVs with the mother-and-daughter pair who own Robbie's doll in Realworld. There's an overlong musical sequence, in which Gosling reprises his singing and dancing shift in La La Land. Mattel's all-male c-suite, led by the one-dimensional Will Ferrell, provide limited laughs, and add little to the plot, beyond an admirable modicum of self-awareness. Products are placed - even Chanel! - with abandon. Still, we are being entertained and, mostly, engaged.The final act sees Barbie and friends manipulate the Kens and prevail. There are no suffragers in Barbieland and, following a unanimous referendum of an all-female electorate, the natural order of things is restored. A dark, compelling, twist looks imminent, but it never arrives.Rather than lean into the exquisite role reversal narrative, director Greta Gerwig retreats from it. Instead of pressing her male audience to consider how they would like it if what patriarchal societies do to women was done to them, her finale ploughs a much shallower furrow into well-trodden ideas about the link between mortality and existentialism: 'I die, therefore I am.'Robbie's Barbie eventually opts not to live in Barbieworld, but as a real, imperfect woman in Los Angeles. This is not apparently because she hates what counterrevolutionary Barbieworld might itself become, but because she likes the idea of being human. How do the remaining Barbies perceive their homeland? Do they support gynocracy? Are they comfortable with the Kens being sidelined? The passive ambiguity here is uncharacteristic of a screenplay that, for the first 85 minutes, hammers home its message relentlessly and precisely.The narrator (Helen Mirren) assures us that one day the Kens might enjoy the same status in Barbieworld that women do in Realworld. It is hard to see even that unambitious prospectus being realised, given the Kens are gainlessly employed, politically disenfranchised and allowed to hold only junior roles in the judiciary. Barbie and Ken experience equality in neither Barbieworld nor Realworld: in both realms one sex is always subservient to the other. Perhaps Barbie ultimately prefers LA because, despite its manifold flaws, it at least has no pretence to being a utopia.In Planet of the Apes, we discover, in the final reel, that Heston's destination is not a dystopian otherworld, but Earth itself. Through nuclear war, man's hatred, greed, and hubris has caused his own downfall. The oppressor has become the oppressed; perhaps man deserves it? In Barbie, Gerwig avoids such a subversive conclusion. Instead, she ends with the weakest element of a thoughtful movie: a syrupy anticlimax more predictable of Hollywood, and Mattel.",a mix master miss opportun,the pictur planet ape revers tradit role after timetravel thousand year futur astronaut charlton heston discov world ape advanc primat human chattelsi hate movi boy good way possibl hate film could happen i wonder human could becom inferior anoth speci if would deserv the film haunt enough age ensur i never dare rewatch itth movi barbi look noth like planet ape it cinematographi exercis highoctan kitsch unapologet saccharin unrealist doll design sell yet explor role revers sex rather speciesbarbieland quasimirror imag realworld film monik presentday california barbieland gynocraci matriarchi the barbi multipl live happi fulfil live they prosper top everi profess public offic they never age bodili imperfect imposs life perpetu merrygoround choreograph parti infinit outfit chang endur sisterhood the men ken decor they unabl perform even basic function physic sexual they lack genit their muscl impress pure show they preen beach surf beyond themon day classic barbi margot robbi awaken discov pristin foot longer arch perfectli highheel shoe she longer walk immacul pedicur tipto flat ordinari sole collect horror sisterhoodrobbi realis someth wrong follow revel compatriot weird barbi set realworld resolv classic ken ryan gosl stow away car the duo eventu arriv santa monica via seri rosetint vehiclesit isnt long gosl discov realworld unlik barbieworld here power held men gosl surpris treat respect becom fascin patriarchi quickli warm paradigm for robbi experi opposit peopl mock daili life threaten fun her selfconfid warp selfconsci ken preced return barbieland quickli set transform pink paradis kendom toyish grotesqu realworld ken charg barbi retain ornament servantsmuch ensu we race chase suv motheranddaught pair robbi doll realworld there overlong music sequenc gosl repris sing danc shift la la land mattel allmal csuit led onedimension will ferrel provid limit laugh add littl plot beyond admir modicum selfawar product place even chanel abandon still entertain mostli engagedth final act see barbi friend manipul ken prevail there suffrag barbieland follow unanim referendum allfemal elector natur order thing restor a dark compel twist look immin never arrivesrath lean exquisit role revers narr director greta gerwig retreat instead press male audienc consid would like patriarch societi woman done final plough much shallow furrow welltrodden idea link mortal existenti i die therefor i amrobbi barbi eventu opt live barbieworld real imperfect woman lo angel thi appar hate counterrevolutionari barbieworld might becom like idea human how remain barbi perceiv homeland do support gynocraci are comfort ken sidelin the passiv ambigu uncharacterist screenplay first minut hammer home messag relentlessli preciselyth narrat helen mirren assur u one day ken might enjoy statu barbieworld woman realworld it hard see even unambiti prospectu realis given ken gainlessli employ polit disenfranchis allow hold junior role judiciari barbi ken experi equal neither barbieworld realworld realm one sex alway subservi perhap barbi ultim prefer la despit manifold flaw least pretenc utopiain planet ape discov final reel heston destin dystopian otherworld earth through nuclear war man hatr greed hubri caus downfal the oppressor becom oppress perhap man deserv in barbi gerwig avoid subvers conclus instead end weakest element thought movi syrupi anticlimax predict hollywood mattel
One for the Identity Lost Generation,"Underneath the corporate irony and plate-spinning, there's a film that is mildly humorous; if not a tad lost with it's identity and message. A battle between feminism and stereotyping. Is this a film for young girls? I don't know, it feels as if it's wondered off the reservation. Is it a film for women - more than likely. There's heartfelt messaging at the curtain closing, but it very much straddles the fence between traditional conservative womanhood and progressive girl boss ""smash the patriarchy"".Speaking of patriarchy, this film drops the p-word countless times. And the image of masculinity is confusing, is Ken masculine or campy and confused? Horse obsessed, gym bro, with a passion for theatrics and fur coats - traditional masculine, doubtful.I don't know who this film was made for, or where it stands on anything.

Okay but,"The Barbie movie, while providing a passable entertainment experience, falls short of achieving masterpiece status. It's important to approach this film with reasonable expectations, understanding that it caters primarily to a specific demographic. As an individual outside that target audience, I found the movie to be enjoyable to a certain extent but lacking the depth and complexity that might resonate more strongly with its intended viewers. The storyline and characters are serviceable, yet they don't offer the level of intricacy that one might find in films aimed at a broader age range. While not a cinematic triumph, the Barbie movie succeeds in delivering a light-hearted and visually pleasing adventure, albeit one that may not fully engage those beyond its designated audience.",okay,the barbi movi provid passabl entertain experi fall short achiev masterpiec statu it import approach film reason expect understand cater primarili specif demograph a individu outsid target audienc i found movi enjoy certain extent lack depth complex might reson strongli intend viewer the storylin charact servic yet dont offer level intricaci one might find film aim broader age rang while cinemat triumph barbi movi succe deliv lightheart visual plea adventur albeit one may fulli engag beyond design audienc

Deep yet hollow,"Was just okay. The acting is super, ryan makes a super funny and suave ken i think. And margot is a perfect barbie, she ate her role up. !this is not a kids movie! Has many innapropriate things and comments i was not expecting. Most of the humour lands for me honestly, i thought it was cute. The diolouge isn't best but it's a movie about barbie what were any of us really expecting.It was kinda confusing towards the end. The begininng was really fun- maybe a little bit annoying but that's just me, like i said, not my type of film. The colors were great, the barbieland set was cute. After they got back from the real world it kinda fell apart for me. I thought they were gonna go a wholeeeee different route than the ken patriarchy taking over? Then the barbies make them fight eachother and make up? And everythings fine? They tried to make it deep and meaningful but it flatlined along the way. It seems like the whole build up was leading to the monolouge scene. I feel the feminist point of the film would've come across better if it was introduced over time instead of having a few blatent comments here and there and then BOOM big monolouge. It was just a lot, but empty at the same time.And i get what they were trying to do in the real world with having barbie be constantly catcalled but that also got to be a lot i think. Like, point proven, all women have had that happen to them. It was a bit overdone and got a little uncomfy.And nothing was ever really resolved in the real world? Besides the mom and daughter with barbie. And then at the end you think barbies getting a job at mattel, first female ceo, feminism, but no she's just going to the gynocologist. Yeah it was a funny and unexpected moment but they had a chance to do something and they didn't take it.Overall much different than expected. This dealt with more serious subjects and got way deeper into patriarchal ideas than i was prepared for. Thought it was going to be lighthearted!So, idk. It was cute- i may be too hard on it cause i enjoy movies that make you think and have deeper elements. All the elements here were blatently there.

Best movie of the year,"I really enjoyed the movie, but it also tore me to pieces. I saw myself reflected in many very difficult situations in my life as a woman, beyond the fact that my feminism allows me to be aware of many things.

"Barbie it's interesting, confusing, and a lot of fun","Barbie is a curious film, and I believe that the high expectations of the general public led to its performance being considered average. The film tries to criticize several things at the same time , criticizing how society puts pressure on women and reflections on self-knowledge, besides that, I assume that at some point someone wanted to criticize large corporations, but all of this gets lost in development and becomes confusing and often it's not clear what the movie really wants to be about, maybe focusing on just one thing or working them all properly would be better. Anyway, the film is fun and manages to get some very loud laughs, and unfortunately this script problem persists in situations that just happen without any development or reason, I hope that in a future sequel this is better worked on.",barbi interest confus lot fun,barbi curiou film i believ high expect gener public led perform consid averag the film tri critic sever thing time critic societi put pressur woman reflect selfknowledg besid i assum point someon want critic larg corpor get lost develop becom confus often clear movi realli want mayb focus one thing work properli would better anyway film fun manag get loud laugh unfortun script problem persist situat happen without develop reason i hope futur sequel better work
Amazing and fun,"I got into the theater with zero expectations, and I can only say I was very positively surprised.I loved the comedy in this movie as I think I haven't had that much fun in a while. And the other thing I love about this is that because the movie is a goofy comedy, you don't have to take the everything too seriously and you just go with it, and you enjoy the comedic ride all the way through the movie.On the other hand, the movie also provides a lot of criticism towards the many flaws in our society and all through the movie you find things, that reflect that, and I believe they are portrayed perfectly.Without spoiling to much I would recommend the movie to anyone as on the one hand I think it produces a lot of important messages and on the other I can't think of anyone who wouldn't enjoy the comedic experience.",amaz fun,i got theater zero expect i say i posit surprisedi love comedi movi i think i havent much fun and thing i love movi goofi comedi dont take everyth serious go enjoy comed ride way movieon hand movi also provid lot critic toward mani flaw societi movi find thing reflect i believ portray perfectlywithout spoil much i would recommend movi anyon one hand i think produc lot import messag i cant think anyon wouldnt enjoy comed experi
A mixed bag that is enjoyable and funny while still being a bit of a let down,"Greta Gerwig's latest offering, ""Barbie"", starring the effervescent Margot Robbie and the charismatic Ryan Gosling, had high expectations to meet. The film provides an ample amount of humor and maintains an enjoyable pace. However, it falls short of its potential as a sharp, thought-provoking commentary on our society's obsession with aesthetic perfection and constructed identities.First, let's talk about the performances. Margot Robbie is fantastic in her role as Barbie, breathing life into the plastic figurine with an effortlessly humorous and convincing portrayal. Her comedic timing is impeccable, and her delivery of the lines lands smoothly every time, making for a lot of laughs.Unfortunately, Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken didn't manage to hit the same high notes. As a Gosling enthusiast myself, it's disappointing to witness his usually nuanced performance taking a backseat. His portrayal was overdone, his actions and dialogue feeling more like caricature than character. However, considering the history of Gerwig's adept directing, it's plausible to believe the responsibility for this creative choice doesn't lie solely with Gosling.As a social commentary, ""Barbie"" delivers some pointed insights into our societal norms and expectations but, frustratingly, its treatment of these complex themes often feels too overt, which detracts from the potential impact. The film's humor, though consistently amusing, lacks the subtlety that could have transformed it into a more incisive satire.The musical elements of the film were, interestingly, among its strongest aspects. The colorful, campy musical numbers added to the film's eccentricity, and it's a shame these weren't more of a focus. Their quirky charm offered a delightful contrast to the sometimes too-obvious comedy of the rest of the film.While it was an entertaining watch, ""Barbie"" didn't quite meet the high expectations I had for a Gerwig-directed social commentary. However, this may be more a testament to the immense respect I have for her previous work than a damning critique of the film itself. It's still an enjoyable movie, full of laughs and energy, and Margot Robbie's performance alone is worth the price of admission.In conclusion, while ""Barbie"" may not have been as witty or sharp as hoped, it still provides a solidly entertaining viewing experience.

Extremely Disappointed!!,"From the way this movie was marketed, I felt, as a lifelong collector, super excited! The beginning got off to a bit of a slow, yet visually beautiful, start. I enjoyed the colorful nods to the dolls I grew up with yet began struggling with the plot about 35% through.I felt like I was being forced into a plot that I was NOT prepared for and before long was wanting to mentally check out.

"A subversive, vibrant and energetic cinematic event!","Barbie is a vibrant and subversive film brought to life by Greta Gerwig with infectiously chaotic energy. The production design is exquisite and the cast is absolutely stacked with great actors and great performances.Margot Robbie is magnificent and Ryan Gosling absolutely knocks it out of the park.Gerwig and Baumbach have created a thematically rich satire that manages to be heavy-handed in its messaging, while sometimes feeling a tad bit too preachy it mostly satisfies. By taking an iconic IP like Barbie in such an unexpected and mature direction, this film is able to instantly crown itself a classic. In an era where Hollywood loved to play it safe, Barbie's boldness reminds us of the power of doing things differently and taking big swings. The film is little over-the-top at times, but it never stops being pure cinematic fun. In the second act the film looses itself a bit, which I think is due Gerwig wanting to make to many statements at once. But the third act puts the focus back on the central aspects and pulls some existencial strings. Gerwig manages to give a beautiful closure to the story while at the same time leave the audience with an uplifting message for BOTH genders.As a man, I get why some would feel discomfort watching this movie, thats okay, but giving it a one star rating for that is absolutely ridiculous. This is a great crafted piece of cinema and no less. Greta Gerwig didn't intend to give a balanced perspective of men versus women with Barbie. She made a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were ""allowed"" to have ""real jobs"" and do the same things as men.I love blockbusters that aren't afraid to take risks and Barbie is one of the most risky blockbusters in recent memory - and one that absolutely succeeds.",a subvers vibrant energet cinemat event,barbi vibrant subvers film brought life greta gerwig infecti chaotic energi the product design exquisit cast absolut stack great actor great performancesmargot robbi magnific ryan gosl absolut knock parkgerwig baumbach creat themat rich satir manag heavyhand messag sometim feel tad bit preachi mostli satisfi by take icon ip like barbi unexpect matur direct film abl instantli crown classic in era hollywood love play safe barbi bold remind u power thing differ take big swing the film littl overthetop time never stop pure cinemat fun in second act film loo bit i think due gerwig want make mani statement but third act put focu back central aspect pull existenci string gerwig manag give beauti closur stori time leav audienc uplift messag both gendersa man i get would feel discomfort watch movi that okay give one star rate absolut ridicul thi great craft piec cinema le greta gerwig didnt intend give balanc perspect men versu woman barbi she made noholdsbar unapologet crazi ride rant real issu woman face sinc allow real job thing meni love blockbust arent afraid take risk barbi one riski blockbust recent memori one absolut succe
"Eh, not for me.","It was not as light-hearted and fun as I was hoping. I wasn't expecting such a deep message to be told to me by a Barbie. There is a lot of satire in the film, that I feel some will take to be truths.But, costumes and sets were on point! I hope that team gets all the nods for their accomplishments. The soundtrack is lacking, too. Maybe I do not have many nice things about this film, other than it wasn't for me. Instead of it being a cute comedy, I became more depressed by watching the movie! Margot and Gosling played their roles well, and I applaud them. But the other all content, was just too deep, and not fun.",eh,it lightheart fun i hope i wasnt expect deep messag told barbi there lot satir film i feel take truthsbut costum set point i hope team get nod accomplish the soundtrack lack mayb i mani nice thing film wasnt instead cute comedi i becam depress watch movi margot gosl play role well i applaud but content deep fun
A film that truly lives up to the hype,"A Barbie movie helmed by Greta Gerwig starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling... what could possibly go wrong? Practically nothing it seems, as this movie is a complete knock out in every possible way.It is hilarious from start to finish with a sharply funny, meta, intelligent script that is matched by the masterfully executed physical comedy.The story is emotional and powerful and meaningful which I did not expect, but this proved to be such a vital and welcome part of the film.The entire cast is brilliant with outrageously camp performances from them all, but the highlights are the two leads. I can't think of two better people suited for the roles than Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. They both give perfectly flawless performances, filled with heart and humour and charisma. Will Ferrell is a scene-stealer with some hilarious comedy as you'd expect, and America Ferrera delivers a great performance with a lot of heart.The visuals are so fun from the sets through to the costumes. It is such a vibrant and colourful film that bursts with creativity, and to top it all off it has a superb soundtrack as well.If you were once a Barbie movie sceptic like me, then think again as it does not disappoint!",a film truli live hype,a barbi movi helm greta gerwig star margot robbi ryan gosl could possibl go wrong practic noth seem movi complet knock everi possibl wayit hilari start finish sharpli funni meta intellig script match master execut physic comedyth stori emot power meaning i expect prove vital welcom part filmth entir cast brilliant outrag camp perform highlight two lead i cant think two better peopl suit role margot robbi ryan gosl they give perfectli flawless perform fill heart humour charisma will ferrel scenesteal hilari comedi youd expect america ferrera deliv great perform lot heartth visual fun set costum it vibrant colour film burst creativ top superb soundtrack wellif barbi movi sceptic like think disappoint
"Not what I expected, mildly thought provoking","What I came away with the most is surprising puzzlement, not so much for the movie's message, but for my inability to account for Margot Robbie's hold on my attention. I can't say this movie impressed me very much, and I doubt many men will enjoy it, but there is time spent with Margot Robbie, who is really unique. I can't really think of another actress who seems to understand the inner workings of a lot more than most of her peers.Her performance pulled me through what seemed a fair description of the problem of patriarchy as seen by women, at least. And an odd depiction of a 'perfect' women's world. I was left thinking Greta Gerwig is almost as unusual as Margot is, but, even so, she seems to not have found an answer to the question she poses in this movie. How do we reconcile the very different world's men and women prefer?It's clever that she uses an iconic doll to make her point, but it's just a way to frame the whole question in a non-threatening way. Still, I can't think of a more entertaining introduction to the issue. And it helps that there are so many great performances in this movie, not to mention the wild sets and energetic production numbers. Not really my thing though I appreciate the skill with which they were rendered.",not i expect mildli thought provok,what i came away surpris puzzlement much movi messag inabl account margot robbi hold attent i cant say movi impress much i doubt mani men enjoy time spent margot robbi realli uniqu i cant realli think anoth actress seem understand inner work lot peersher perform pull seem fair descript problem patriarchi seen woman least and odd depict perfect woman world i left think greta gerwig almost unusu margot even seem found answer question pose movi how reconcil differ world men woman preferit clever use icon doll make point way frame whole question nonthreaten way still i cant think entertain introduct issu and help mani great perform movi mention wild set energet product number not realli thing though i appreci skill render

"Funny, Charming, Clever & A dose of Preachy","Clever, funny, charming with bright bold colors and visually stunning. But that is what I heard going into the film and I was not disappointed in any way in that area. The sets are also amazing and the Barbie worlds they created vs. The fake real world sets that they made; really cool.The only part that got old fast was the preachiness of the writing. I got it the first 50 times you made it clear about feminism and that women should run everything and be everything. That is fine, but any filmmaker that keeps repeating their point or theme too much risks boring the audience by overstating or over playing your message.

Greta Gerwig never misses!,"Watching Greta Gerwig's interpretation of womanhood through universal icon, Barbie, was a beautiful and uniting experience.This movie celebrates the transition from girlhood to womanhood, as well as the universal experience of just existing in this day and age.Not to mention the filming techniques used to film alongside the soundtrack and even the cast made the movie feel like a trip back to playtime in childhood.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have so much on screen chemistry that makes the movie feel fluid and fun, and the insanely diverse cast of both Barbies and Kens was an astounding and commendable casting choice.Barbie is definitely Oscar worthy, and represents something much more than a doll.",greta gerwig never miss,watch greta gerwig interpret womanhood univers icon barbi beauti unit experiencethi movi celebr transit girlhood womanhood well univers experi exist day agenot mention film techniqu use film alongsid soundtrack even cast made movi feel like trip back playtim childhoodmargot robbi ryan gosl much screen chemistri make movi feel fluid fun insan diver cast barbi ken astound commend cast choicebarbi definit oscar worthi repres someth much doll
Not for pre teens,"While I was able to enjoy the Barie movie for it's sarcasm and sardonic, dark humor, it is subject matter way too mature for children. After the movie was over, I heard mostly pre teen girls disappointed there wasn't very much Barbie in the movie. So just a warning to parents, please heed the the PG-13 warning.I loved the clothes, shoes and accessories in this movie! As for me personally, Ryan Goslings Ken was as good as it was possible. Ken in any other world would be a ""10""! Love that song! It was cute and very silly and super adorable! Obviously, Ryan Goslings is too old for Ken, so he did the best he could. Would I see it again? Not really. As a little girl I used to wonder what would happen if Barbie and Midge became real? I stopped playing with them, and learned to kiss boys. Real life came crashing in. I still keep those memories of Barbie.

Clever but much too long,"The film has Margot Robbie and she's wonderful. Ryan Gossling is good but has been overhyped in this role. Will Farrell is doing his usual shtick, which is funny. However, the film seemed longer than Oppenheimer ( which is brilliant filmmaking). After twenty minutes I turned to a friend and asked if Barbie had a plot. Five minutes later a story did start to surface, but it was predicable and not terribly involving. Full disclosure: I never played with Barbie or destroyed a Barbie, so clearly I am not the intended audience. Still, there are some very clever bits, the design is super, the last line is a really laugh out loud surprise, and Robbie is a delight in anything.",clever much long,the film margot robbi she wonder ryan gossl good overhyp role will farrel usual shtick funni howev film seem longer oppenheim brilliant filmmak after twenti minut i turn friend ask barbi plot five minut later stori start surfac predic terribl involv full disclosur i never play barbi destroy barbi clearli i intend audienc still clever bit design super last line realli laugh loud surpris robbi delight anyth
Missed potential,"There were moments - they were there - but not seized on or developed. This movie tried to do too many things and made too much fun of itself to be interesting. I don't understand all of the buzz around this movie. I mean...how ideal...send made up characters who who live in a magical place out to the real works to learn a lesson about themselves. I've seen that movie before. The nostalgia was great as a Barbie playing little girls of the 70s but that wasn't enough to bring me into Barbieland. The whole storyline of idiots running Matel was 100% unnecessary. The movie I wanted to see at its core was Barbie trying to find the woman that needed her, that woman's relationship with her daughter, and then learning about herself in the process. I wanted so much to like it but might be one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",miss potenti,there moment seiz develop thi movi tri mani thing made much fun interest i dont understand buzz around movi i meanhow idealsend made charact live magic place real work learn lesson ive seen movi the nostalgia great barbi play littl girl wasnt enough bring barbieland the whole storylin idiot run matel unnecessari the movi i want see core barbi tri find woman need woman relationship daughter learn process i want much like might one worst movi ive ever seen

I now know that I am Kenough.The writing of this film was brilliant. It could have been a strange and tacky film; but instead it reminded us of the endless possibilities of stories and imaginations.

"I mean, Barbie is really an everything.","As someone said, this is a bittersweet pill. A film that intends to be entertainment and toy marketing, but somehow, it brought tears out of my eyes.I love it. I love everything about it. I love everything it represents: identity crisis, toxic masculinity, and glorifying the value of dolls. Greta Gerwig took an idea that seemed outdated, like ""Barbie,"" to tell a vivid contemporary story. At the very same time, the film also teases itself and all sorts of pop culture. And all the productions-oh my, they are all very pleasing to my eyes and ears.Some that I'm stuck on are the half-jokes/half-seriously tone, which makes the final act not as powerful as it should be. The overexplaining of characters, when they said everything they thought but didn't really show it in another way, and Ken's arc are not completely closure to me.In the end, Billie Eilish's song is the key to winning my heart.

"Funny, charming, and somewhat confused","Barbie is a film with undeniably gorgeous production design and distinct visual charm, and it's at its best when it embraces its surreal absurdist humor and runs with it. This has some of the funniest sequences of the year.Robbie, Gosling, and most of the rest of the cast have impeccable comedic timing. The line delivery is somehow both dry and full of energy.The world that the story presents is gleefully ridiculous and when it fully leans into this tone, it's wonderful.The problems arise when the script fluctuates wildly (and frequently) between goofy dumb comedy and heavy-handed social messaging. It's jarring and often seems to be treating us, the audience, like we're stupid.The script is so heavy-handed in presenting a shallow view of the world and reductionist view of both men and women, yet is seemingly so convinced of its intelligence and wit.A caricatured world is all good and fun, but it's not exactly conducive to making a commentary on incredibly nuanced issues.Thankfully, the film sort of figures out how to balance all of this by its final minutes, and it really does have a knockout ending.There's a lot to love here.

PERFECT,"At the beginning, it cleverly reflects social issues through gender reversal, but not merely as a reversal. Both gender groups retain their essence, and the ending isn't about one group's victory over the other, but about working together. It encompasses not only gender equality but also recognition and acceptance of others and oneself. It's not about feminism, patriarchy, or gender confrontation. It's not about stereotypes or perfectionism. It's about gender equality, embracing individuality, and mutual understanding. This movie isn't exclusively for women; it showcases the fierce presentation of chuunibyou (middle school syndrome) in both genders. Outstanding performances and dance sequences keep the entire film engaging without clichés.",perfect,at begin cleverli reflect social issu gender revers mere revers both gender group retain essenc end isnt one group victori work togeth it encompass gender equal also recognit accept other oneself it femin patriarchi gender confront it stereotyp perfection it gender equal embrac individu mutual understand thi movi isnt exclus woman showcas fierc present chuuniby middl school syndrom gender outstand perform danc sequenc keep entir film engag without clich
Good jokes and a disappointing Ending,At the interval I was surprised of how much I was enjoying Barbie with its amazing humour which was super ironic and subtle commentary on male patriarchy and consumerism. The overall theme of the movie was also quite good reflecting many aspects of human life and how it becomes more critical with age. But it was so disappointing in the third act which takes away the brilliant build up. Ryan Gosling showed his ranged and made me laugh so many times. Margot Robbie shined brilliantly just like she does during the whole film. But I expected more from Barbie and Greta Gerwig didn't satisfy me. She should have tried for a different sort of ending.,good joke disappoint end,at interv i surpris much i enjoy barbi amaz humour super iron subtl commentari male patriarchi consumer the overal theme movi also quit good reflect mani aspect human life becom critic age but disappoint third act take away brilliant build ryan gosl show rang made laugh mani time margot robbi shine brilliantli like whole film but i expect barbi greta gerwig didnt satisfi she tri differ sort end

Although, I feel like the plot turned simplistic and took the easy way out.

I think I'm in the wrong demographic,"I saw this movie in theatres, and I found it kind of underwhelming. Each and every act of the film feels so different and disconnected from the other, and by the end it feels like the plot looses traction. But that doesn't mean I thought the movie was bad, I thought it was funny and charming all throughout, but I guess my issue is that I'm in the wrong demographic. Near the beginning and near the end, there's a strong theme of motherhood and the troubles of being a woman, and as a man, I can't relate. As a result, I had a hard time relating to a lot of this movies big plot points and emotional moments. And on top of that, halfway though it becomes exceedingly boring.

Creative and emotionally heavy film,"I appreciated the creative nature of the film and applaud breaking out of the formulaic box. Having said that, there are still narratives present in the film that are prominent in todays culture. Gender Identity is still a common theme which plays out on a multitude of levels in the film. I am not an academic and probably can't articulate the intellectual philosophies the movie contained.As a woman who played with Barbies as a child, I hold this beloved icon to high esteem. The concept of Barbie seems like a convenient path to drive many of these political narratives in general. Personally, I think it would be even harder to make a regular movie for young girls with Barbie as the main character.Ryan Gosling in an amazing actor. I feel like he stole the show as Ken. I enjoyed the singing and dancing numbers the most. Most of the movie was very heavy handed emotionally. I would have preferred different casting in Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrel's roles. Different actors would have brought a fresher take in general. Margo Robbie was amazing as Barbie. The sets were ok.Overall I would not go out of my way to see the movie again.

Be what you want to be,"Ryan Gosling as Ken I loved too much, but Margot Robbie as Barbie is perfect.I understood the message very well, it's great to see how they destroy little by little the stereotypes of a ""pretty"" person and replace it with the reality that many human beings live. And after all, men and women (and every living being) deserve to be happy.One of the scenes I loved, aside from the opening reference, is the ""Just Ken Exclusive"" scene. I would have loved to see more of Ken!!!!

Not worth the hype,"The movie as it is is really great and the work on it deserves all the best critics...
But I personally haven't strongly connected to the storyline. They really could have came up with much better strory line which would make this amazingly done movie even better.I don't know but watching the trailer for the movie I thought that it would be story about Ken being spy from the outside world, but it turned out not to be true.Also I do not find the film funny at all, maybe I did not understand some jokes, maybe I ignored some but I don't think it's funny at all.But as I said at the very beginning the movie directing is really great and the whole movie team did the great job as well as actors did. <3.",not worth hype,the movi realli great work deserv best critic but i person havent strongli connect storylin they realli could came much better strori line would make amazingli done movi even betteri dont know watch trailer movi i thought would stori ken spi outsid world turn truealso i find film funni mayb i understand joke mayb i ignor i dont think funni allbut i said begin movi direct realli great whole movi team great job well actor
Best Communal Cinema Experience Since Endgame,I was all in for this movie before I saw it. As time went by I got concerned my expectations were impossibly high and I'd inevitably be disappointed. Saw it opening night in a packed cinema all dressed in pink (yes the men too). I laughed far more than I expected and had a damn good cry. My ridiculous expectations were exceeded.Barbie is funnier and more touching than I was expecting. It's just the right kind of meta and deals with gender roles and our complicated feelings about Barbie and what she represents in a balanced and realistic way. I'm not sure how I left a film after staring at Margo Robbie and the rest and felt better about myself than before I went in. See it in the cinema if you can. Going from a loudly giggling crowd to suddenly being able to hear a pin drop when the film hit some hard truths was wonderful. Fill two hours of your time with joy and Kenergy!

"I think I set the bar too high, it unfortunately fell flat for me","I'm guinely sad to say this movie fell incredibly flat in my opinion. There was no spark, a film trying to do what it was trying to accomplish needed that spark to make it get it to where it was trying to go! It felt as if it was missing that connection the audience/viewers want to receive and feel from beginning to end, forgetting you're watching a movie, that spark that makes you get lost in the story in a best kind of way. I had beyond high hopes for this film. I was truly ecstatic to see it, and was rooting for it every step of the way... all the way till I stood up from my theater seat as the credits rolled. I had this glooming feeling of confusion(not because I did not get it) and unfulfillment. I literally felt bad for wanting to immediately turn to my sister, whose birthday it was, and ask her what she thought because I knew I'd than have to answer that same question to not only her but to everyone else that was going to ask me what I thought. The trailers and hype around it presented it as if it was going to be a hilarious and powerful satire indie film that would go down in cinema history. Yes it had an incredibly outstanding lineup cast, inspiring director and writers, but it was just not all it was hyped up to be. I'm definitely in the target audience, so there's no judgment that should be passed on that thought, I just wasn't that captured by it. This is all MY PERSONAL OPINION, but I did not find it funny, I literally caught myself forcing laughter at some of the scenes that were supposed to be funny because I felt bad the jokes were just not landing, and I really did want to like it. It felt alittle all over the place at times, and rushed in multiple scenes that felt there should have been more there. Yes, there was alot of great speeches that were moving, but sometimes it felt like there were so many it took away from others and you got lost in all the underlying meanings. It felt like someone was saying ""look over here, now over here, no back over here!"" The cast was good, visually appealing, and unique, but the movie as a whole just felt lacking. There was substance, but it got lost in all the messages and lessons it wanted us to take from it. Not something I would just put on to watch multiple times. It's a ""once is enough for me"" type of film. I got the message loud and clear, I just felt no connection was able to be made the way the story was told. Maybe if we got to explore the characters more and build that connection to feel one with the film.",i think i set bar high unfortun fell flat,im guin sad say movi fell incred flat opinion there spark film tri tri accomplish need spark make get tri go it felt miss connect audienceview want receiv feel begin end forget your watch movi spark make get lost stori best kind way i beyond high hope film i truli ecstat see root everi step way way till i stood theater seat credit roll i gloom feel confusionnot i get unfulfil i liter felt bad want immedi turn sister whose birthday ask thought i knew id answer question everyon el go ask i thought the trailer hype around present go hilari power satir indi film would go cinema histori ye incred outstand lineup cast inspir director writer hype im definit target audienc there judgment pas thought i wasnt captur thi my person opinion i find funni i liter caught forc laughter scene suppos funni i felt bad joke land i realli want like it felt alittl place time rush multipl scene felt ye alot great speech move sometim felt like mani took away other got lost underli mean it felt like someon say look back the cast good visual appeal uniqu movi whole felt lack there substanc got lost messag lesson want u take not someth i would put watch multipl time it enough type film i got messag loud clear i felt connect abl made way stori told mayb got explor charact build connect feel one film
Wretched!! Simply.. WRETCHED!,"From Reel Tunez, The Radio Show All About the Movies.In fairness, maybe I'm the wrong demographic (Male/50's) for this movie.. but I did watch it with my wife. I can only describe it as wretched! It was seriously like watching people make up their lines and the storyline on-the-fly. It was so terrible, it was nauseating.I didn't have high hopes for it simply because it didn't look interesting to me, so it was certainly not a matter of being let-down. It was like ""Grease"" meets ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" (but both Grease & RHPS are fun movies.. and I really liked them!) This had the campiness of Grease.. and the cheesiness of Rocky Horror. But the parts of those movies we liked or found endearing was complete absent in Barbie.Visually.. I'd say it was certainly interesting. The premise of the movie also had some ability to be entertaining. But this thing was a massive waste of time in my book.Though Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are actors I like in many movies, it's so beyond campy that I couldn't even find it funny (though a few, VERY few, areas had some laughs). Maybe part of the reason I found the movie ""wretched"" is because it was as if the director actually instructed the actors ""be as funny and over-the-top as you can"". It was like watching the 1980's bad cast of Saturday Night Live TRYING to be funny. Simply painful to watch. This is a rare movie I'll never want to watch again.

Pretty in pink,"Before my favorite movie if 2023, the color purple, was released. Barbie was my favorite of that year, having seen it twice in theaters and once on rewatch. I thought nothing was going to surpass it, after another rewatch it is still in my top 3, only being surpassed by the color purple and Oppenheimer. Featuring one of my favorite actors, Margot Robbie, I knew I was in for a treat.Barbie has one of the most powerful storylines of the year, instead of focusing on cancel culture and toxicity (like a certain Black Christmas remake) Barbie focuses on actually empowering women to the fullest, with tons of heartfelt messages about acceptance, self-love, and insecurity.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are both brilliant here, every scene is beautifully shot and directed. And it has one of the most powerful ones with the old woman on the bench, along with one of the best song and dance sequences I've ever seen in my life.Barbie gives a new definition to pretty in pink, A+",pretti pink,befor favorit movi color purpl releas barbi favorit year seen twice theater rewatch i thought noth go surpass anoth rewatch still top surpass color purpl oppenheim featur one favorit actor margot robbi i knew i treatbarbi one power storylin year instead focus cancel cultur toxic like certain black christma remak barbi focus actual empow woman fullest ton heartfelt messag accept selflov insecuritymargot robbi ryan gosl brilliant everi scene beauti shot direct and one power one old woman bench along one best song danc sequenc ive ever seen lifebarbi give new definit pretti pink a
Yeah it's fun and worth watch but...nah,"Don't get me wrong, it's a fun movie and nice but it's not very mind blowing or even so good. I did expect a little bit of more good movie, if you know what I mean. But it's pretty much just a fun ride and goofy movie. There are some smart things about the real world and some feminine stuff. I think that the last bits of the movie were a little too talky and they just talked and talked about feminism and it was a little bit boring there. It was pretty touching sometimes, you may even shed a tear. But it's worth watching. But if you expect a masterpiece it's not that. Do not excpect that. Think of it as a funny goofy movie.

A Huge Generalization at Best,"What can I say? I went into this expecting at least a few laughs. The trailers didn't even show or come close to reveal the heart of the plot. So here it is:
Everything is so horrible and wrong for women today, and most men hate women. Now, as a woman watching this movie, I felt as if I was supposedly being told how much my life as sucked, and how much men have stolen from me. Which is not at all the case. I've had the pleasure of working with men who respect me in a good career, and found the movie distastefully disrespectful of everything I've ever accomplished.I had a few laughs, but found the movie lacking a sense of real purpose and direction. It seemed as though it was seeking to inform everyone about this new agenda that women should be in charge of everything. Wow, sounds like sexism to me. I'd prefer equality, which is something that we currently have.",a huge gener best,what i say i went expect least laugh the trailer didnt even show come close reveal heart plot so everyth horribl wrong woman today men hate woman now woman watch movi i felt i supposedli told much life suck much men stolen which case ive pleasur work men respect good career found movi distast disrespect everyth ive ever accomplishedi laugh found movi lack sen real purpos direct it seem though seek inform everyon new agenda woman charg everyth wow sound like sexism id prefer equal someth current
Barbie review - let's go party!,"Greta Gerwig's endlessly entertaining flick isn't the first Barbie movie to be put to screen. However, where other precedents have stopped at princess castles and the magic of women's ballet, her 2023 piece shows every facet of the ubiquitous toy, from her stereotypical ""Barbie World"" to the ""Real World"" implications of Barbie on the feminist and body-positivity movements, and it does so with humor and heartache. This unapologetically-weird-and-all-the-better-for-it film is the crème de la crème of ""franchise"" movies, and has a genuinely moving and empowering message to boot.Margot Robbie does right by Stereotypical Barbie, who lives a perfect ""girl power"" life in the matriarchal Barbie World. However, as her façade of impeccability begins to crumble, she must traverse the realm between the worlds and find the person playing with her to restore order to her universe. But, she soon discovers, Ken, dying for Barbie to reciprocate his romantic pursuits, stows away on her journey to the Real World, and, after being enlightened on the ""joys"" of patriarchy, resolves to institute it back in Barbie World.This sounds like a ridiculous movie, but fortunately, Gerwig's filmmaking frequency is tuned into this observation, and she plays her silliness cards at every turn, morphing a potential mess of clichés and shallowness into a riotous meta dramedy. Even Helen Mirren's small role as the narrator, nostalgically ushering the characters' journey forward and poking fun at the poor casting choice of Robbie during a scene where she complains about how hard it is to be her, is impossible to ignore, and so is the delicious plastic dreamscape that is the film's cinematography and scoring (hats off to Dua Lipa). Add in Gerwig's lush, expansive direction to her adroit comedic and dramatic timing and we're delivered with an end result that far exceeds expectations on every level.Of course a film like this will enrage some. A female director and writer? Female actors? Of all backgrounds? A message that says that women should be independent, autonomous, strong people that deserve to be treated with dignity and respect beyond the gendered realm of housewifery? Outrageous! But all kidding aside, I encourage everyone to watch this film in its entirety rather than prejudging it from what certain people have proclaimed are its diabolical goals and understanding that it isn't misandrist (Ken also has a reckoning at the end and accepts his own identity) or political propaganda (since when was female empowerment owned by any single political entity?) but rather a long overdue take on the entanglement of toys like Barbie and feminism, but also how we as a society can improve and make everybody realize that they matter beyond their measurements, possessions, or relationship status.

"Barbie Is A Great Movie, Locked In A Plastic Box","Oppenheimer was bad. In a bad way. And when I reviewed it, I was thought everything would have been better to watch than that. And finally, I had the opportunity to watch Barbie. I thought it will be a tipical advert film, where yes, they make joke from the dolls and there's some jokes for the adults too, but overall it's all about: BUY MORE BARBIE !And I had almost right. But just ALMOST.Barbie tries to be a society critic, an advert film, a comedy, a kids movie, and it almost works well in those types. But there are some bad things I want to discuss, so here's how this critic will work, I will show how it fits in the types I written down, and after that I will write the conclusion.Society Critic Part: The movie absolutely great in this type, it both shows the stupidity of the PC world, and the terrifying fact we live in a world where is homophobia and racism, sexism. Most of the jokes are about that.Advert Film Part: Exactly because the Society Critic part, it fails to be a good advert film, because who do you want to want to get Barbies. Small Children! And small children will not understand, the jokes with our society, they understand the slapstick jokes. Okay there's some in the film. But there's too few to interest a child.Comedy Part: It's good. This movie IS funny. I can't say more.Kids Movie Part: As I said, it's not working that much. But I have to tell, it can be a bit too silly for adults. So that's a problem too.Conclusion: It's a good movie ! Watch it max two times, great stuff. But if it wasn't a Barbie movie, it could work better.",barbi is a great movi lock in a plastic box,oppenheim bad in bad way and i review i thought everyth would better watch and final i opportun watch barbi i thought tipic advert film ye make joke doll there joke adult overal buy more barbi and i almost right but almostbarbi tri societi critic advert film comedi kid movi almost work well type but bad thing i want discus here critic work i show fit type i written i write conclusionsocieti critic part the movi absolut great type show stupid pc world terrifi fact live world homophobia racism sexism most joke thatadvert film part exactli societi critic part fail good advert film want want get barbi small child and small child understand joke societi understand slapstick joke okay there film but there interest childcomedi part it good thi movi is funni i cant say morekid movi part a i said work much but i tell bit silli adult so that problem tooconclus it good movi watch max two time great stuff but wasnt barbi movi could work better
Man's world isn't just about woman,"For some not so fun to see it the other way around.The expectations that challenge women on every step are impossible to empathise with. But are well said in ""breakout spell"", that woman isn't allowed to make mistakes, yet she is responsible for all the mistakes. And the problems that Barbie experiences the second day are part of life and we know that world isn't perfect and we all deal with it in our own way whether in flats or heels. And same goes for Kens, there is no need for stereotypes, just be Kenough.Living in 21st century is challenging for all, but let's take everybody's heads out of their a*ses and enjoy this ridiculousness that is happening all around shown on screen.The most spectacular part of it all is the art direction and attention to detail that brought so many easter eggs.",man world isnt woman,for fun see way aroundth expect challeng woman everi step imposs empathis but well said breakout spell woman isnt allow make mistak yet respons mistak and problem barbi experi second day part life know world isnt perfect deal way whether flat heel and goe ken need stereotyp kenoughliv st centuri challeng let take everybodi head ase enjoy ridicul happen around shown screenth spectacular part art direct attent detail brought mani easter egg
Barbie (BAR) movie review by Most Fair,"BAR is a comedy movie set in two worlds, Barbie's and the 'real world'. This review won't dig further into the plot.BAR is a pleasant surprise; it's pretty good fun and the actors, music and scenography all make an exceptional job.The comedy of BAR is self ironic and sarcastic and nails it pretty much spot on. Middle part of the movie gets a bit ordinary and dull but doesn't ruin the film overall.The movies scenes are incredible and really stands out. This also applies to the costumes and soundtrack.

Surprising,"This movie definitely wasn't what I expected it to be. Although it was funny, it also had me question a lot of things in life. It hit the heart, it made me cry, and it really shows what the reality of the real world was and how we can all discover ourselves and not be making ourselves into someone we aren't. I walked into the theater thinking it would be all fun and like any other Barbie animation made in the past, but it definitely stood out and all the actors did great. Most women will definitely feel a sense of courage to do what they want in life and maybe also the men.This was a 10/10 movie.

It was good but not what I would consider an empowering film.,"I was expecting a little more given the hype and was a little disappointed by a few aspects of the film. Firstly I'll say that Margot as Barbie and Ryan as Ken were great individually. A large part of why this movie was good enough is because of what they brought to the characters and the story on screen. I found watching Ken discovering ""patriarchy"" to be hilarious. However, one of the first critiques I have is that it felt like the movie didn't spend enough time in Barbieland. The serious shift felt a little too sudden when it could have benefitted from fleshing out the ""perfect"" life and the character dynamics of the barbies and Kens with more substance. Because I felt that was missing, the emotions Barbie was experiencing in the real world fell flat to me, which brings me to my second point.The movie's use of heavily weighted political words by the barbies and kens water down the overall message this film is trying to convey. I think being a woman in the real world is a lot more complicated than going on a beach and getting harassed. Or seeing a bunch of men working and socialising in corporate. I understand the way the movie addresses this is meant to be with a comical and somewhat obvious tone, and it was. However, it could have benefitted from also adding a bit more of a layered experience to these issues which would consequently add more dimensions to when these politically weighted words were used. It just felt, in my personal opinion, to be thrown around for the convenience of making a point amongst all the silliness but with no real material message.It was an enjoyable film in its own merits. However, I was disappointed in the development of the storyline and the characters so I give Barbie a 7/10. I think Greta is talented and I preferred her previous work like Lady Bird. This was a little too mainstream without much substance, thus, Barbie's empowering message fell flat to me.",it good i would consid empow film,i expect littl given hype littl disappoint aspect film firstli ill say margot barbi ryan ken great individu a larg part movi good enough brought charact stori screen i found watch ken discov patriarchi hilari howev one first critiqu i felt like movi didnt spend enough time barbieland the seriou shift felt littl sudden could benefit flesh perfect life charact dynam barbi ken substanc becaus i felt miss emot barbi experienc real world fell flat bring second pointth movi use heavili weight polit word barbi ken water overal messag film tri convey i think woman real world lot complic go beach get harass or see bunch men work socialis corpor i understand way movi address meant comic somewhat obviou tone howev could benefit also ad bit layer experi issu would consequ add dimens polit weight word use it felt person opinion thrown around conveni make point amongst silli real materi messageit enjoy film merit howev i disappoint develop storylin charact i give barbi i think greta talent i prefer previou work like ladi bird thi littl mainstream without much substanc thu barbi empow messag fell flat
"Great marketing and great actors, mediocre movie","Started well, had some great moments and acting was good.However, the point of turning Kenland back to Barbieland...what was supposed to convey? That Barbies aka women actually want to live looking like Barbies in their almost identical Barbiehouses? That it's women against men and men their dreams are stupid?I found the Mattel team going to Barbieland totally out of context and it didn't add anything either to idea or humor of the movie. Men leading the patriarchy in real world were made to look silly and idiotic, which didn't add anything to the ideas, but felt embarrassing rather than funny.I found the movie weird, confusing and not empowering at all.",great market great actor mediocr movi,start well great moment act goodhowev point turn kenland back barbielandwhat suppos convey that barbi aka woman actual want live look like barbi almost ident barbiehous that woman men men dream stupidi found mattel team go barbieland total context didnt add anyth either idea humor movi men lead patriarchi real world made look silli idiot didnt add anyth idea felt embarrass rather funnyi found movi weird confus empow
Gerwig must have wielded a pen that ignites,"Barbie wasn't supposed to be that deep but it was. Greta Gerwig must have wielded a pen that ignites to write this story down with so much boldness, creativity, and awareness that no one could ever imagine for an already perfect plastic to deserve.It wasn't a surprise Margot Robbie could kill this role and make us all believe she was born for this because she was. She is my favorite actress after all. She led the film as perfectly as her Barbie but it was Ryan Gosling that took me by surprise with how much he embodied kenergy that came so explosive like some atomic bomb designed by some civilian scientist (pun intended). Then there's America Ferrera (watch out for the scenes that earned her the ""heart of the film"" ribbon) and the scene Billie Eilish's ""What Was I Made For"" was made for. (If I were to predict with all confidence who's bagging an Oscar nomination? It's Billie for Original Song.)Barbie indeed subverted expectations and stereotypes. And I hate that it worked, that's why I loved it.",gerwig must wield pen ignit,barbi wasnt suppos deep greta gerwig must wield pen ignit write stori much bold creativ awar one could ever imagin alreadi perfect plastic deserveit wasnt surpris margot robbi could kill role make u believ born she favorit actress she led film perfectli barbi ryan gosl took surpris much embodi kenergi came explos like atom bomb design civilian scientist pun intend then there america ferrera watch scene earn heart film ribbon scene billi eilish what wa i made for made if i predict confid who bag oscar nomin it billi origin songbarbi inde subvert expect stereotyp and i hate work that i love
"Original, colorful, and fun","Barbie opens with an homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey before quickly transitioning to the visually stunning, artificial reality of Barbieland, where the sky is a painting and the food imagined. It's colorful, the set designers display fully realized artistic visions-it's nice to see a movie that isn't over sanitized for a mass audience, a movie that doesn't play it safe. You can see the influences Greta Gerwig wanted to include from old Hollywood all over the place. Margot Robbie is the star as Barbie, fully embodying the perfect Barbie life until cracks start to form in Barbieland.Barbie presents two dystopian worlds, one a bad version of the real world, and Barbieland, where men are pushed aside and given nothing to do at all. Ken discovers the idea of the patriarchy after being respected for the first time in his life in the real world because he never had any power. It was a desperate attempt to gain equality from a member of the oppressed class. Ken is essential to the emotional core of the film. He's how we see the injustice of Barbieland. The movie isn't man-hating, it uses the poor treatment of the Kens by the Barbies to say how dumb discrimination is and that we should all treat each other as individuals, capable of working within our individual talents and skills and that we should be authentic to who we are.** Significant spoilers after this point**The movie also tells us through a memorable monologue from Gloria (thanks to America Ferrera's excellent performance) that we don't have to be perfect, we can embrace being ordinary. She doesn't want the perfect Barbie life either, she wants an ordinary Barbie that's also a mom, loves her family, and embraces her imperfections as good things. The concern with insecurity caused by Barbie is made less tactfully by Gloria's daughter who goes on a screed calling Barbie a fascist (you can't tell me this was intended to be self serious and not a way to poke fun at Gen Z self righteousness).Robbie's Stereotypical Barbie also learns these values, shown when she is sitting at the bus stop in the real world and looks over at the older woman next to her and tells her she is beautiful. Barbie sees beyond the plastic perfection of Barbieland. This is why it's so important she leaves Barbieland at the end of the film, she rejects the reimposed female domination of Barbieland and the point of the film is to say the real world is better than what women may imagine happens in Barbieland.

"Started good, then turned into a lecture","I really wanted to like the movie, and I totally enjoyed the first third of it, until it turned into a lecture on patriarchy. Women are portrayed as infinitely oppressed people who can't do anything except for crying about their existence.Don't get me wrong, I expected it to be about feminism and empowerment, but not that awfully straightforward about it.I could've been a great movie. A 10/10 movie, but it feels like the authors just hate men so much, they can't think of anything else.I also feel sorry for all female executives at Mattel. The board of directors is portrayed as oppressively male-only, to maintain the narrative.To sum up, you gonna love it if you want to feel sad and oppressed about being a woman. Not so much if you just like Barbies and want to have a good time.",start good turn lectur,i realli want like movi i total enjoy first third turn lectur patriarchi woman portray infinit oppress peopl cant anyth except cri existencedont get wrong i expect femin empower aw straightforward iti couldv great movi a movi feel like author hate men much cant think anyth elsei also feel sorri femal execut mattel the board director portray oppress maleonli maintain narrativeto sum gon na love want feel sad oppress woman not much like barbi want good time
Whimsical story that grows deeper,"I was not sure I wanted to watch Barbie being a dude and thinking this is aimed at Kids or whoever liked 'Frozen', that Disney cartoons. But I gave it a try and by the end felt merrier about it. It has that feel good factor running all along that makes you appreciate the Director's and Writer's talents considering the story is about Barbie and her diaspora of dolls and the plastic world they inhabit
Yet the films manages to illicit emotions, fun and merriment all along while still keeping true to the Dolls' origins and without it being preachyI liked the world it creates both for Barbie and the Real World and the interactions that go in between, it acts as a satireneedless to say the actors are amazing and keep true to their characters.

Gosling Steals the Show.,"Walk into this film, not completely knowing what to expect but came out pleasantly surprised. Good set designs a lot of good shots throughout the film. Pretty solid humor throughout the film. So overall good experience. But now, in terms of casting Margot Robbie was a great choice for Barbie, but man does Ryan gosling really steal the show almost makes me wish he was in more comedies. Will Ferrell also makes an appearance and there's a pretty good job. And in terms of the overall message definitely wasn't as preachy as most people put it out to be. So I don't think the overall message was as bad as some people had it out but overall a fan film would recommend.",gosl steal show,walk film complet know expect came pleasantli surpris good set design lot good shot throughout film pretti solid humor throughout film so overal good experi but term cast margot robbi great choic barbi man ryan gosl realli steal show almost make wish comedi will ferrel also make appear there pretti good job and term overal messag definit wasnt preachi peopl put so i dont think overal messag bad peopl overal fan film would recommend
"This is an mportant movie, hilarious, joyful and profound","It is a philosophical masterpiece. Clever and thought provoking, hilarious and modern. I didn't expect that at all. The constructed reality is as complex as if Morpheus from ""the Matrix"" offered you the third pill which conjoins two worlds. Deserves the hypeI hope I don't dive super deep here, if I say that the beginning reminds me of Wlater Benjamin's ""Berlin Childhood"". Playing with toys knows to be joyful and lucid, but really reats some new and confusing ""realty"". To add up, this movie seems to be much more philosophical than ""The Matrix"", I would say. That dimension opens up right afterer ""blue pill vs red pill"" reference was made, because here we hd those two realities colide, ""imagenary"" and ""real*, creating the conjoined ""third realm"" where we see how both realites influence and shape each other. As Slavoj Zizek once pointed out: ""we need a third pill"", so here it is.At that point in the movie, story takes a new turn bringing into the focus some familiar social & existential struggles of modern times, providing us with its own critique of it. And it llooks like they had great success doing it. Seemingly effortlessly, they manged to bring out some greater point, keeping the great dynamics, adding the great amount of comedy to it. That was actually so impressive.Here ill pull the breaks, I would rather not to try to explain the movie or interprete it, .. Just wanna to say in the end that I strongly rrecommend it for watching. It's fun, profound, its reveling and bringing out so many different layers talking about the social/existential dilemas and actually you can learn much from watching it.

"Great acting, horrific plot.","I found this film to be disappointing and and an overall letdown, to say the least.The humour, acting, soundtrack, casting & costumes were AMAZING. Don't get me started on the dance choreography and the sets. I found that those aspects really created an amazing atmosphere for what the perfect Barbie world is was intended to be. Michael Cera was absolutely hilarious, and I couldn't stop laughing at the broken barbie, played by Kate McKinnon.Nevertheless, although it was clear they were trying to exaggerate the message on purpose, I found the plot to be just.. stupid. Barbie fights the patriarchy, or, Ken on a horse. I found the humour during multiple points in the movie to be dry, especially stressing how much Ken loves horses.The ending, I found to be mushy. I was expecting something better, and just kind of felt let down. Almost like it was lazy.In conclusion, I'd give this movie a solid six out of ten. It's kind of sad, as I am the targeted audience for this film- a young, feminist, progressive woman. Don't get me wrong, this movie was great at parts- but, in the end, was definitely overhyped.",great act horrif plot,i found film disappoint overal letdown say leastth humour act soundtrack cast costum amaz dont get start danc choreographi set i found aspect realli creat amaz atmospher perfect barbi world intend michael cera absolut hilari i couldnt stop laugh broken barbi play kate mckinnonnevertheless although clear tri exagger messag purpos i found plot stupid barbi fight patriarchi ken hors i found humour multipl point movi dri especi stress much ken love horsesth end i found mushi i expect someth better kind felt let almost like lazyin conclus id give movi solid six ten it kind sad i target audienc film young feminist progress woman dont get wrong movi great part end definit overhyp

"Barbie is catchy, fun, important and... that's it.","Greta Gerwig, took the most famous doll of humanity, a luxury cast and made a good film with an important message!Barbie offers almost 120 minutes of fun, captivating and fluid moments. Mixing real elements with ""drawn"" scenarios, it manages to bring the two worlds together in a balanced and intelligent way, varying between ""cartoons"" and the real world.It also shows in a very intelligent way all the difficulties that women go through in their lives, such as the lack of respect for their intellectual and physical property, as well as illustrating a series of moments that illustrate patriarchy and the disrespectful way in which many men treat women and think they are superior based on their gender. A message that Ryan Gosling had in a great performance to emphasize the perspective that unfortunately still reigns in many men today.Speaking of the cast, Ryan Gosling had a script that favored him, with several scenes and different roles that allowed him to show all his versatility as an actor, and the reality is that he delivered a high-level performance, the best in the film imo, and that he managed not only to give strength to the message that he wanted to convey, but also to elevate the film to another level with his musical performances. On the other hand, imo, Margot had a script that didn't exploit all of his acting skills. Don't get me wrong, her acting is very good, within what was provided, the performance is very good, however I think the script could have given her more, due to the versatility she has!And my first negative point is precisely that. The script was too attached to the message it wanted to convey and did not use all the potential that ""Barbie"" provided, such as the affective side and its overall positive impact on many women. Furthermore, the focus on the concept limited the development of characters and a cast that had more to offer!The dialogues also suffer from a lot of fluctuations, the good dialogues are really good but seem very disconnected from the rest, as the construction even them felt lazy. It's as if they didn't connect to what just happened in the last few minutes and just came out of nowhere. It's a shame, because there are really good speeches!Finally, the message got across clearly and the most important thing is clearly retained. This movie was never about pink or a doll. It was about women and the rights they are due! Respect, freedom, and justice in relation to the opportunities they should have. Doors should open according to the work carried out and the skills demonstrated, never to the gender or color of a person! Love is love no matters what. Respect is to everyone, there's no ""but""! However, I think Greta missed an incredible opportunity to make a stronger ""statement"" about equal rights, duties and opportunities for all!In short, it's a good film, light, funny and entertaining, and can be watched several times as something to ""pass the time and have fun"" but should be watched, at least once, in a serious and dedicated way for all the message it has!",barbi catchi fun import that,greta gerwig took famou doll human luxuri cast made good film import messagebarbi offer almost minut fun captiv fluid moment mix real element drawn scenario manag bring two world togeth balanc intellig way vari cartoon real worldit also show intellig way difficulti woman go live lack respect intellectu physic properti well illustr seri moment illustr patriarchi disrespect way mani men treat woman think superior base gender a messag ryan gosl great perform emphas perspect unfortun still reign mani men todayspeak cast ryan gosl script favor sever scene differ role allow show versatil actor realiti deliv highlevel perform best film imo manag give strength messag want convey also elev film anoth level music perform on hand imo margot script didnt exploit act skill dont get wrong act good within provid perform good howev i think script could given due versatil hasand first neg point precis the script attach messag want convey use potenti barbi provid affect side overal posit impact mani woman furthermor focu concept limit develop charact cast offerth dialogu also suffer lot fluctuat good dialogu realli good seem disconnect rest construct even felt lazi it didnt connect happen last minut came nowher it shame realli good speechesfin messag got across clearli import thing clearli retain thi movi never pink doll it woman right due respect freedom justic relat opportun door open accord work carri skill demonstr never gender color person love love matter respect everyon there howev i think greta miss incred opportun make stronger statement equal right duti opportun allin short good film light funni entertain watch sever time someth pas time fun watch least seriou dedic way messag
"Now I am become death, destroyer of the patriarchy","(Note: I highly recommend seeing both this film and Oppenheimer as a double feature. Both are heavy handed films that have characters going through an existential crisis and are consumed with thoughts of death. You would think these two films have nothing in common, but I'm dead serious - no pun intended.)When your film has your narrator saying the word ""feminism"" in the first five minutes, you know it's going to be problematic.Now, don't get me wrong. I have no problem with feminism and I consider myself a feminist. Some of my favorite films have feminist characters. I knew going in this film was going to be woke. I just didn't realize how woke till I saw it, which was kind of a disappointment anyway.First off, don't let the cutesy pink marketing fool you. This is not a film for kids, but that happens quite a lot in Hollywood. For example, Drop Dead Fred was a film I saw when I was 10, but it was really for adults. But at least it wasn't woke. I felt kind of sorry for the little girls I saw wearing their pretty pink outfits and dresses knowing that probably much of the preaching against the patriarchy and lack of genitalia jokes were going to go over their heads.Yep. I said what I said. It only gets worse from there.Margot Robbie plays the titular Barbie who lives in Barbieland with all her fellow Barbies that can do it all and have it all. The Kens are kind of just...there. The main Ken played by Ryan Gosling, gets tired of being from friend zoned and taken for granted by Barbie. When Barbie starts to have thoughts of her own mortality, has flat feet, and cellulite, she is advised by Kate McKinnon (one of the few bright spots in the film as Weird Barbie) to go to the Real World to find the girl who's playing with her and make everything right. Ken decides to stow away in Barbie's pink Corvette. Both of them discover the Real World is not what it seems.My biggest problem with this film was the constant preachiness, especially when Barbie and Ken go to the Real World, and it never really stops from there. I resented Greta Gerwig for ""giving the game away"". There's a way to talk about feminism without hammering it over the head and alienating half your audience, in this case men, but I doubt many men will see it. It's like that South Park episode when Randy makes a musical that explicitly talks about oral sex until he is advised to tone it down and hide the message in subtext. That's what Gerwig and her partner Noah Baumbach should have done with the story. This is a film that definitely skews toward a female audience. It needed to be more subtle with the messaging. I would have preferred a fun, silly, colorful Barbie film rather than having a woke agenda pushed on me. Unfortunately, that's the direction Hollywood seems to have embraced these days.However, the visuals were bright, fun, and colorful along with the hairstyles and wardrobe. I liked that they filmed in the Venice Beach Boardwalk and other areas around LA. Despite the diversity of the cast, my mom was unhappy that she didn't see a Hispanic Barbie and Ken (even though we saw a white, black, and Asian Ken). If there were any in the cast, I didn't see them. America Ferreira and her daughter are indeed Latina, but that wasn't enough for her. She does have a point, though, but we could be wrong and missed them. Will Ferrell is wasted as the CEO of Mattel, but I don't care for him anyway, so it didn't really matter that I didn't see him much. Rhea Perlman did have a nice little part as the creator of Barbie, Ruth Handler.This film was very strange and I felt kind of alienated by it. Plus, the last scene of the film was anticlimactic and totally bizarre. I get the good intentions by the filmmakers, but it was way too preachy for me. Legally Blonde was the closest to a Barbie film up until this point and it was a feminist film that never felt like it was preaching to its audience. Elle Woods was a blonde Barbie type character who was underestimated because of her looks, but manages to showcase her intelligence and strength as a successful lawyer without the message of the story becoming too heavy handed and retaining the lighthearted playfulness throughout, which is what Barbie is missing. I think I'll just stick to that film instead.",now i becom death destroy patriarchi,note i highli recommend see film oppenheim doubl featur both heavi hand film charact go existenti crisi consum thought death you would think two film noth common im dead seriou pun intendedwhen film narrat say word femin first five minut know go problematicnow dont get wrong i problem femin i consid feminist some favorit film feminist charact i knew go film go woke i didnt realiz woke till i saw kind disappoint anywayfirst dont let cutesi pink market fool thi film kid happen quit lot hollywood for exampl drop dead fred film i saw i realli adult but least wasnt woke i felt kind sorri littl girl i saw wear pretti pink outfit dress know probabl much preach patriarchi lack genitalia joke go go headsyep i said i said it get wors theremargot robbi play titular barbi live barbieland fellow barbi the ken kind justther the main ken play ryan gosl get tire friend zone taken grant barbi when barbi start thought mortal flat foot cellulit advis kate mckinnon one bright spot film weird barbi go real world find girl who play make everyth right ken decid stow away barbi pink corvett both discov real world seemsmi biggest problem film constant preachi especi barbi ken go real world never realli stop i resent greta gerwig give game away there way talk femin without hammer head alien half audienc case men i doubt mani men see it like south park episod randi make music explicitli talk oral sex advis tone hide messag subtext that gerwig partner noah baumbach done stori thi film definit skew toward femal audienc it need subtl messag i would prefer fun silli color barbi film rather woke agenda push unfortun that direct hollywood seem embrac dayshowev visual bright fun color along hairstyl wardrob i like film venic beach boardwalk area around la despit diver cast mom unhappi didnt see hispan barbi ken even though saw white black asian ken if cast i didnt see america ferreira daughter inde latina wasnt enough she point though could wrong miss will ferrel wast ceo mattel i dont care anyway didnt realli matter i didnt see much rhea perlman nice littl part creator barbi ruth handlerthi film strang i felt kind alien plu last scene film anticlimact total bizarr i get good intent filmmak way preachi legal blond closest barbi film point feminist film never felt like preach audienc ell wood blond barbi type charact underestim look manag showcas intellig strength success lawyer without messag stori becom heavi hand retain lightheart play throughout barbi miss i think ill stick film instead
"Whit, charm, and lots to say","This movie was fantastic. Leave it to the writers Greta and Noah to handle the topic of womanhood so well. The details on the set were outstanding.

"Great execution, but its main message is nothing new","I watched the Barbie movie a few weeks after it came out, so I was expecting to experience all the emotions people raved about on Twitter. Overall I thought the movie was well-produced, but I think its marketing was misleading. Now, I know that this movie couldn't be marketed in a way that was truthful to the plot because less people would go to watch; people wanted to see a movie about the bright and bubbly character of Barbie, not a Barbie whose whole persoality is a complete 180 from her original. With that being said, I think the message the mvoie was getting at of how people should be free to be who they are and not conform to society's standards, etc is nothing we haven't heard before, which brings up the question of did we really need a movie to tell us this? Another question I have is why did Ken have a song? It didn't benefit the plot but that can be left to your own volition. I wouldn't say I was disappointed in this movie, but I think it was overhyped just a little bit.",great execut main messag noth new,i watch barbi movi week came i expect experi emot peopl rave twitter overal i thought movi wellproduc i think market mislead now i know movi couldnt market way truth plot le peopl would go watch peopl want see movi bright bubbl charact barbi barbi whose whole persoal complet origin with said i think messag mvoie get peopl free conform societi standard etc noth havent heard bring question realli need movi tell u anoth question i ken song it didnt benefit plot left volit i wouldnt say i disappoint movi i think overhyp littl bit
Barbie May Not be Wrapped in Plastic but She's Definitely Fantastic,"The Barbie movie got a lot of buzz from critical praise but I was intrigued even before that because there were stories about how it had quite the journey through development. I don't know what the previous versions would have looked like but I wanted to start with how Greta Gerwig's version is structured. It would have been pretty easy to play to formula writing and developing the script, to just repackage a popular framework and insert Barbie with some different touches (paint it pink and glam it up a little). But the creative team wasn't content to do just that here, my favourite part of Barbie is the unconventional directions the plot shoots off in. Barbie coming to the real world could have been predicted but the parallel journey of Ken, Barbie bonding with Gloria and Sasha, the odyssey that the Mattel executives go on are so off-kilter and fresh. It's all firmly tongue-in-cheek as well, the movie is deliberately poking fun at both itself and the system (including the corporate owners of the Barbie brand Mattel). Is there the occasional misstep? Sure, but this movie was so rare that while I could have nitpicked and poked at inconsistencies, I didn't want to. Barbie encourages you strap in for a ride and I can forgive the occasional bump in the journey if you deliver the goods. With such a silly tone and some well-intentioned rhetoric, Barbie absolutely does that and more.In Barbie's debut, we travel to Barbieland, a candy coated toy-like version of reality that is perfectly curated to the needs of all the Barbies (and to a lesser extent all the Kens). The production design, costuming, sets, lighting are all dynamic and creative. The creative team does an excellent job of adding little touches to flesh out the world while maintaining the glossy veneer of the toys. The cars, the houses, the outfits are picture perfect and magnify how much money and effort clearly went into designing and creating this world. They use set dressing to great comedic effect too and it helps sell how strange and eerie coming to reality would be for our heroes.Margot Robbie is pulling double duty as both the star and a producer in this feature. Robbie is her typical excellent self here, she's what the movie is centred around but she isn't afraid to share the spotlight with some of the other heavy hitters in the cast. She's as advertised in Barbie, she's funny, dramatic and magnetic all in equal measure. Ryan Gosling is really going for it as Ken, he's also underrated as a comedic talent. The jokes are fairly simple here but his enthusiastic delivery is what sets his work apart. Some people have mentioned awards consideration, I wouldn't go that far but he's great and he showed up to work. My favourite performance actually came from America Ferrera as Gloria. She's got great chemistry with both her on-screen daughter Sasha (played by an also great Ariana Greenblatt) and Robbie. She's playing more the everywoman in the minefield that is the world today with a frenetic energy that totally fits. I also wanted to congratulate Rhea Perlman, Will Ferrell (in a very President Business-esque turn), Issa Rae and Alexandra Shipp for some excellent work in their respective supporting roles as well.Barbie has plenty to say and uses the platform effectively to get the message across. There's so much packed in here from how problematic it can be excelling as a woman in today's world, the fragility of the male psyche, how corporations flip-floppy attitude towards gender politics are based upon greed instead of the collective good etc. Depending on the scene, some of the material is delivered in a more subtle manner than in others but I was continually impressed by how the creative team was able to get the message across while weaving it into the movie without coming across as too heavy-handed. I'll also concede that I felt like they got 80-90% of the way there instead of the whole 100% (there's still an aftertaste of non-equality at the end). But I'll also concede that I'm not the target demographic here, I completely approve of the movie in its completed form and I'm all for what the message is trying to say (woman power, working through insurmountable obstacles bit by bit, getting in touch with yourself through introspection and acts of kindness, shape your own standards for beauty etc.)Barbie was a little uneven for me but I really enjoyed the overall package. Barbie is bold, vibrant, well-made and delightfully weird in the best of ways. The performances are great and I liked that despite it taking advantage of existing intellectual property, it stands out by being a self-contained story that doesn't hinge on a Mattel Cinematic Universe or suggest that there will be sequel after sequel.

"Life in plastic, it stops short of being fantastic","The real power of cinema came to the forefront as two films went head to head against one another this Friday. One was based on a childhood icon that attained the status of a cultural phenomenon over the years as evident from the massive craze around it and the other was based on an icon in the realm of science whose invention changed the course of the world and was directed by a man who has emerged as a phenomena himself in the world of cinema. The former celebrates girl power and inclusivity while the latter is largely a man's world built on a critique of warfare and corrupt politics. To address the elephant in the room, ""Oppenheimer"" beats ""Barbie"" on all fronts without having to put up much of a fight, irrespective of what the box office figures might denote.That said, ""Barbie"" is a good film, a fun watch, that could have been so much more. The first half was a joyride providing all the fun that the film must have intended to provide during the course of its runtime. It was a job well done by the art directors and set designers as they enabled in creating a vibrant, colourful world without any trace of morbidity. The Barbie houses, the beach, the house of the Weird Barbie, the roads, the Netherlands-like fields, the sea - they were created with a perfection that one can only dream of, only to let you sink and immerse yourselves in the colours that Gerwig's vision could have borrowed straight of the rainbow. To conceptualize and execute such a world is an extraordinary accomplishment with the sets perfectly complementing the colourful lives of our Barbies. The Barbies come from all walks of life, hold important positions, and stay at the frontline of Barbie life - a contrast to the human world where a bigshot at a top private firm claims to Ken that they don the mask of inclusivity so that they do not have to deal with a backlash. At the center of all these Barbies is Margot Robbie's Stereotypical Barbie who is ever joyful and unfettered by emotions like grief or anxiety. She is the paragon of the beauty as it was once envisioned, hence the stereotype about her. The Kens have nothing much to do in this world other than bicker over their vulnerabilities. All was well until the real world began messing with the Barbie world and our protagonist is hit by concerning thoughts like death. Depression takes root in her mind and she has to embark on a journey to the real world to not only fix her own life but also that of her owner. ""Barbie"" should have stopped here or should have taken an alternate route to the denouement as the second half just steers out of control and every theme seemed to being heavily hammered into youe mind as if the script had lost confidence in the viewer to effortlessly let those ideas in. The last 30 minutes felt stretched out of control except for the incredibly done Ken song - one of my favourite moments from the film. Gerwig had let the viewers have most of the fun in the first hour but the script lost the steam as it trudged to the finish line. Gerwig is worthy appreciation for her vision, for the world she has accomplished in this film, for the infinite ideas she has established - feminism to motherhood to inclusivity to bending all gender stereotypes. She has been sensitive and empathetic in her handling of depression. If only she had not taken the approach of a moral parable in the second half this film could have been so much better.""Barbie"" packs in a stellar cast with every single one of them investing the best of their qualities in the project. Robbie looks absolutely pretty as she should have in this role and handles joy, sadness, existential crisis with the capability that she as an actor has always possessed. Issa Rae as President Barbie and Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie are two other standouts. But the real star of the show is Ryan Gosling - his Ken-ergy is infectious and will keep you in splits throughout. Just look at his incredible comedic chops when Ken visits the human world. You just can't have Ken-ough of Gosling's Ken. ""La La Land"" showed that he could dance really well, a skill he has put effectively to use in the Ken song too.In the end, Gerwig's film is a pretty looking tribute to a pretty cultural phenomena. It could have had a little more of the ""muchness"" (as the Mad Hatter would say in ""Alice in Wonderland"") in the fun department. It dazzles throughout but the baggage of its heavy-handedness drags it down to an extent.

I didn't like it - but it was still a masterpiece,"This movie was an aesthetic dream . Just looking at it was a treat . Scene to scene , color schemes , outfit choices . This kept you drawn in and you wanted to keep looking - even if you didn't like anything else - the straight up visual was worth it .The satire and political commentary was absolutely on point . This movie didn't try to hide what it was or what it was doing - it showed you trailer to finish and I loved that . There was nothing put in by accident - everything was thoughtful and served a purpose . This was true for every joke , every clothing choice , every character , every emotion ,The humor was funny - but this was my one complaint . I don't like crude humor and I am a prude and honestly some of it was crass . Nothing ""bad"" and I recognize I am a grinch in that way - I laughed but this was the reason I would not watch it over and over , just don't value that type of joke . But I recognize and respect the writing and it was very important to the movie .The casting and acting - INCREDIBLE! I mean really - every single person was better than the next . Margot Robbie was absolutely incredible . Every single supporting cast member was so well casted and acted . America Ferrara was amazing and her monologue was probably the highlight of the film and the most powerful part - every woman ( every person ) can relate in some way if not all ways .Hats off to Greta for this film - she took and assignment and got an A+ and then earned some extra credit - one of the great directors .Great film - and I respect it so much as a film - doesn't mean I have to love watching it ( that's what for me makes it an 8 instead of a 10, but honestly it probably deserves an 11)IGo see it - it's absolutely worth it.",i didnt like still masterpiec,thi movi aesthet dream just look treat scene scene color scheme outfit choic thi kept drawn want keep look even didnt like anyth el straight visual worth the satir polit commentari absolut point thi movi didnt tri hide show trailer finish i love there noth put accid everyth thought serv purpos thi true everi joke everi cloth choic everi charact everi emot the humor funni one complaint i dont like crude humor i prude honestli crass noth bad i recogn i grinch way i laugh reason i would watch dont valu type joke but i recogn respect write import movi the cast act incred i mean realli everi singl person better next margot robbi absolut incred everi singl support cast member well cast act america ferrara amaz monologu probabl highlight film power part everi woman everi person relat way way hat greta film took assign got a earn extra credit one great director great film i respect much film doesnt mean i love watch that make instead honestli probabl deserv igo see absolut worth
No reason to be a hater,"I was excited to see this movie after hearing how much people liked it. I anticipated it having strong messages and it did, but it was a little all over the place. I'm not sure there actually was a cohesive message, but I found myself very emotional at moments during this film. I think it speaks to both men and women who feel societal pressures to be certain things and act certain ways. The music is amazing, and the Ken dance sequence might have been my favorite thing I have seen at the movies this year. This movie is also hilarious throughout. I left not knowing exactly how I was meant to feel, but I did enjoy all the pieces even if they didn't come together completely.Does NOT need a sequel or a Mattel cinematic universe!

Not even Plastic,"This film is filled with cheap cinematic and comedic tricks dying for attention and relevance. In the end, the moments are stale and require as sense of ""I guess I should laugh or chuckle a little, poor things.""The film preys solely upon the desperate desire permeating American culture for something, anything, please. (Nope still don't have anything original or high-quality in this Era of film-making).Most sequences of the film are a collection of ""unbelievable!"" instagram-like moments strung together with a lazy unity that affirms one thing: confusion.This film grossly underestimates the IQ of its audience or lacks the subtly and nuance to pursue the complex arguments regarding its central socio-political themes. It says only so much, afraid at every step to be cancelled but also trying to stand firm in some desperation for truth, to help stand up to that mean Mattel! The same Mattel that Warner Bros (who produced the Barbie film) is partnered with.Margot Robbie tries to give it her all (she can open one eye tear stream with the best of them) but her performance lacks the quiet composure of all struggling with identity issues. It is surely a barbie-rific film! Although even the fake smiles of the actors seem fake, almost as if they are saying, ""I can't believe I am doing this."" They almost solemnly predict the end of the film before a single ounce of real joy can be seen/had. The entire film is depressing, even where it is supposed to be joyful.There is no great sense of play. It appears everyone is outstandingly self-conscious and hyper aware. Weirdly hyper aware. These aren't artists (with perhaps the exception of Gosling). These are everyday men and women pretending to be actors and absurdly conscious of it. One can only get along with color palettes, explosions, and circus jokes / ""provocative"" one liners for so long. The real attempt at story was shaky at best. Amazingly studios allow Gerwig to direct a high school film project with a 150 million dollar budget and a volunteer casting call of beginning drama students and a few pretty people who always wanted to be in a movie.The long wait gets longer. When will art take a step forward?

I think this movie is good for all ages because it will teach all woman how life really is and it will teach young girls the reailty of this world and how to prepare for obstacles that come there way.

what to expect,"Me and my sister both enjoyed this film and disliked it. The beginning of the film starts off with little girls destroying baby dolls because the new ""barbie toy"" had been created. Me and my sister were shocked and also disappointed in the scene. The movie was really funny, it had us laughing a lot and we enjoyed it. They made men look absolutely stupid, as in if there was just one leadership position filled by a man it was the end of the world. That part annoyed us and we strongly disagreed w it. Overall, i think that the movie could have been better, but it wasn't the worst i've ever seen. I definitely enjoyed certain moments of watching the film, but definitely not every moment. I recommend this film for the barbie world experience. I think every actor/actress fulfilled the role they played. However i don't think that the story was 100% in line and think it could have been a bit better. :)",expect,me sister enjoy film dislik the begin film start littl girl destroy babi doll new barbi toy creat me sister shock also disappoint scene the movi realli funni u laugh lot enjoy they made men look absolut stupid one leadership posit fill man end world that part annoy u strongli disagre w overal think movi could better wasnt worst ive ever seen i definit enjoy certain moment watch film definit everi moment i recommend film barbi world experi i think everi actoractress fulfil role play howev dont think stori line think could bit better
what is happening to this world?!,"Let me get it straight! People had the choice of watching this film and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, and they chose this?! WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THIS WORLD?!I dare say that it was one of the worst movies I've watched recently. Chaotic plot with lots of holes in it and no time to show all the points the director meant to show. I mean, the director was trying to change the whole universe's patriarchy with this little pink movie! Which ended up being a disaster! This film was an insult to both feminists and anti-feminists.The performances were even worse. This was Margo Ruby and Ryan Gosling's worst performance so far.A total waste of time.I am positive that If it weren't for the trillion dollars of advertisement, this movie would have crashed at the box office.",happen world,let get straight peopl choic watch film christoph nolan oppenheim chose what is happen to thi worldi dare say one worst movi ive watch recent chaotic plot lot hole time show point director meant show i mean director tri chang whole univers patriarchi littl pink movi which end disast thi film insult feminist antifeministsth perform even wors thi margo rubi ryan gosl worst perform fara total wast timei posit if werent trillion dollar advertis movi would crash box offic

Barbie Movie does give an Identity to Barbie of GenZ,"""I want to do the imagining. I don't want to be the idea."".When my kid informed me he and his friends were going to see a Barbie movie, I couldn't believe it. The stereotypical mother in me instantly responded. Seeing as how MI and IJ were running in parallel in theatres, I was taken aback and asked him why a group of boys would be interested in seeing Barbie. Will there be any girls there? I'm guessing I probably sounded kind of dorky in his ears. His response, though, was typical of his generation:This is a spoof and not a movie aimed at just girls, Mom. But, like any mother, I made arrangements to watch the movie myself before he did. Also, the other reason was that as a kid, I had eight dolls, and the majority of my time went into playing with them and building stories. And only Barbie was one of those dolls whose identity was recognised consistently over the globe. Barbie therefore represents the shared imagination of all kids who play with it across the world.It was the right decision to see this film because otherwise I would not have realised what a brilliant move it was for the brand to reach out to younger consumers. Barbie is a great gimmick for a rebranding campaign to appeal to Generation Z, which places an emphasis on pragmatics.We all know that Barbie has a checkered history. Barbie's version as a math-averse doll was not received well. Barbie, packaged with a ""don't eat"" diet handbook, protested. Someone who seems black on the exterior but is really white on the inside was being mocked by Oreao's crazy cookie Barbie. The creepiest thing was pregnant Barbie with babies in her belly, and the oddest thing was when Barbie went through puberty. Hijab Barbie and Virus Barbie both sparked new debates. Parents were largely concerned about the FBI tip of a security threat regarding the Video Girl Barbie.Most criticised among Gen Z was Barbie's excessively slender body, which has been an undesirable role model for women. It precisely articulates the enormous problem of existential crises that the outside world has manufactured and which individuals have mindlessly embraced.To begin with, the film explored the same themes, including the existential difficulties brought on by the persistence of patriarchy and Barbie stereotypes. The story starts with Barbie living a happy life in Barbieland, but she notices that she is developing human consciousness. To find answers, she has to travel to the real world in order to restore normality. As she and Ken enter the real world, Barbie is overwhelmed to see the many ways in which women are treated as objects and devalued. Multiple sets of eyes scrutinise all of their actions. Both Barbie and Ken's masculine awakenings also go through existential crises. Later in the movie, with Ken's changed behaviour after going to the real world, Barbie's attempt to appease Ken's manly ego by playing a weakling is satire. However, the much-touted ""gender war"" is seen humorously despite the fact that it still exists, whether people accept it or not.Now, coming to the technical part of the film, the Barbie-land segment was overdone. The transition from Barbie Land to the actual world was also too long; a crisp cut here, as in Jumanji, would have made more sense. So the movie has a sluggish start, but it picks up speed and becomes engaging as time goes on. The humour was really cliched and cheap, so that wasn't great.Both Margot's and Ryan's performances were excellent. While the actors were all spot-on, the film's direction let it down by not keeping the action moving at a good clip and by delivering a confusing muddle of a plot and a message that left viewers with no clear conclusions. A more succinct conclusion would have been fantastic. Though I did like the part at the end where, at the workplace, Barbie prefers Flat Sandals over heels, I was relating all this to my pageant life, where wearing a minimum of 3.5 inches of heels was mandatory before stepping out of your room in public. In the movie, Barbie leaves the fake world behind.To end with my favourite line by Barbie's creator, Ruth Handler, played by Rhea Perlman: ""Humans have only one ending. Ideas live for ever.""
The movie is a good introduction to the world of dolls for those who haven't seen anything like it before. It is a case study in itself, showing how the power of sentiment is a driving force in the doll industry. After a year of record sales during the epidemic, last year saw a dip, so it's easy to see why Mattel is counting on the new Barbie film to reverse the trend by syncing up with generation Z's pragmatic thinking.",barbi movi give ident barbi genz,i want imagin i dont want ideawhen kid inform friend go see barbi movi i couldnt believ the stereotyp mother instantli respond see mi ij run parallel theatr i taken aback ask group boy would interest see barbi will girl im guess i probabl sound kind dorki ear hi respons though typic generationthi spoof movi aim girl mom but like mother i made arrang watch movi also reason kid i eight doll major time went play build stori and barbi one doll whose ident recognis consist globe barbi therefor repres share imagin kid play across worldit right decis see film otherwis i would realis brilliant move brand reach younger consum barbi great gimmick rebrand campaign appeal gener z place emphasi pragmaticsw know barbi checker histori barbi version mathavers doll receiv well barbi packag dont eat diet handbook protest someon seem black exterior realli white insid mock oreao crazi cooki barbi the creepiest thing pregnant barbi babi belli oddest thing barbi went puberti hijab barbi viru barbi spark new debat parent larg concern fbi tip secur threat regard video girl barbiemost criticis among gen z barbi excess slender bodi undesir role model woman it precis articul enorm problem existenti crise outsid world manufactur individu mindlessli embracedto begin film explor theme includ existenti difficulti brought persist patriarchi barbi stereotyp the stori start barbi live happi life barbieland notic develop human conscious to find answer travel real world order restor normal a ken enter real world barbi overwhelm see mani way woman treat object devalu multipl set eye scrutinis action both barbi ken masculin awaken also go existenti crise later movi ken chang behaviour go real world barbi attempt appeas ken manli ego play weakl satir howev muchtout gender war seen humor despit fact still exist whether peopl accept notnow come technic part film barbieland segment overdon the transit barbi land actual world also long crisp cut jumanji would made sen so movi sluggish start pick speed becom engag time goe the humour realli clich cheap wasnt greatboth margot ryan perform excel while actor spoton film direct let keep action move good clip deliv confus muddl plot messag left viewer clear conclus a succinct conclus would fantast though i like part end workplac barbi prefer flat sandal heel i relat pageant life wear minimum inch heel mandatori step room public in movi barbi leav fake world behindto end favourit line barbi creator ruth handler play rhea perlman human one end idea live ever the movi good introduct world doll havent seen anyth like it case studi show power sentiment drive forc doll industri after year record sale epidem last year saw dip easi see mattel count new barbi film revers trend sync gener z pragmat think
Barbie Movie left me in tears,"I was super excited for the movie since the day they announced it and I've been looking forward to it. I was ready with my pink shirt, popcorn and tickets to the early screening expecting a fun loving and very pink movie.And it sure was a very pink and fun loving movie, but I was not expecting the turn it took. It made me go through so many emotions I wasn't expecting to feel, twist and turns that made me laugh, moments that made me cry and the ending was fantastic to say the least.The Barbie Movie is everything I was expecting and so much more, I think the highlight, other than the amazing message, casting and storytelling, was when John Cena appeared.In summary, I'm not the same person I was 1h and 54m ago.",barbi movi left tear,i super excit movi sinc day announc ive look forward i readi pink shirt popcorn ticket earli screen expect fun love pink movieand sure pink fun love movi i expect turn took it made go mani emot i wasnt expect feel twist turn made laugh moment made cri end fantast say leastth barbi movi everyth i expect much i think highlight amaz messag cast storytel john cena appearedin summari im person i h ago
Barbie,"I wasn't expecting much, after all, it is a movie about a doll - however, I was pleasantly surprised that it managed to develop a story that it was relevant and had a strong emotional core.Obviously, it isn't without flaws: it got too campy for my tastes (but not fully over-the-top) and it got a little too lost in its own message towards the end. Regardless, it never lost the entertainment factor that a movie about Barbie should have - so I can only give props to the director and the actors.For the first few minutes, I was worried that the movie was going to be just ""stupid fun"" but as they progressed the plot, it got better and better - I think the resolution of both plotlines of Barbie and Ken were brilliant and quite satisfying.The highlight was the comedy, the relationship between the characters and their commentary about feminism, consumerism and patriarchy.",barbi,i wasnt expect much movi doll howev i pleasantli surpris manag develop stori relev strong emot coreobvi isnt without flaw got campi tast fulli overthetop got littl lost messag toward end regardless never lost entertain factor movi barbi i give prop director actorsfor first minut i worri movi go stupid fun progress plot got better better i think resolut plotlin barbi ken brilliant quit satisfyingth highlight comedi relationship charact commentari femin consumer patriarchi
Tremendous Fun that's full of heart,"First, no actress on earth could have done this role other than Margot Robie. She's as if Barbie came to life (spoiler alert-she does). Margot is incredible in this. From the 2001 inspired opening (which had me laughing my head off) to when she's depressed and appears to be Barbie left behind by a little girl. The stiff legs, the arms, the way she rolls over-hysterical. The rest of the cast, especially America Ferrara, carry the story well and no one, no one is laughing at being in the movie. There are many, many Barbie related easter eggs, including one my wife pointed out to me: The interior of America's car is the same color as one of the original Barbie cars. The movie is fun without being preachy and if you pay attention-you may just learn something. One last thing, the great Dame Helen Mirren narrates!

I didn't expect an Emmy or Grammy type performance in this movie, but this movie was awful. First off, we fell asleep watching it. Twice! Tried it again with some friends and it just got worse as each minute wore on. It did cause us to chuckle a few times but it just wasn't consistently funny nor was it a good drama.

"a witty, modern day satire with a well presented ending","Greta gerwig does better to feminism than judith butler with this brilliant piece.Margot robbie, ryan gosling, america ferrera they all marvelous in the movie. I believe cillian murphy will get the oscar but gosling is such a good challenge with his portrayal. Also, america ferrera is a good actress but somehow she always plays similar woman portrayals, i wish she would try thriller genre, she has that aura in her. Will ferrell was too much for me, he also plays same characters for such long time.The main message in the movie which "" a woman can do/be whatever/whoever she wants"" is crystal clear. In a much better way than twisting old fairtales to ""girlboss"" movies which does no good to strong womanhood, au contraire, being confusing for girls to be strong/leader in anytime in any circumstances.

"An uneven, yet enjoyable summer blockbuster!","Last year, I saw the popular summer blockbuster & pop cultural phenomenon, Barbie. I generally enjoyed it for the most part, but it had a few flaws: While the movie was very fun, it was also way too long! It had an overlong third act with multiple climaxes, that just wouldn't end! Also, the movie had a very conflicting tone: It couldn't decide if the film was a comedy movie, a Bollywood musical, or a message movie! Despite Barbie's overlong running time & inconsistent tone, it was still quite an enjoyable summer movie!Even with warts and all, both actress Margot Robbie and Director Greta Gerwig performed yeoman workmanship on this film. It is a regrettable shame that the Academy Awards people didn't even bother to acknowledge their efforts with any Oscar nominations for them. Thinking ahead for the eventual sequel, Warner Bros. Should remember studio founder Jack Warner's movie making motto: ""Leave the messages to Western Union!""",an uneven yet enjoy summer blockbust,last year i saw popular summer blockbust pop cultur phenomenon barbi i gener enjoy part flaw while movi fun also way long it overlong third act multipl climax wouldnt end also movi conflict tone it couldnt decid film comedi movi bollywood music messag movi despit barbi overlong run time inconsist tone still quit enjoy summer movieeven wart actress margot robbi director greta gerwig perform yeoman workmanship film it regrett shame academi award peopl didnt even bother acknowledg effort oscar nomin think ahead eventu sequel warner bro should rememb studio founder jack warner movi make motto leav messag western union
Nice scenography,"Well, scenography is nice, wardrobe is nice and actress are pretty. The plot is non existent and the whole movie tries to be something it's not - a social commentary so it dives in whole other area and topics and fails. I didn't have any expectations coming to the cinema, I just assumed it was light and funny movie but instead I got a speech about patriarchy and men's world. Not to say it isn't but it's not something you would expect from a Barbie movie that was marketed as fun and comedy movie.Development of the characters is non existent so they are constantly changing their mood and personality without any explanation.",nice scenographi,well scenographi nice wardrob nice actress pretti the plot non exist whole movi tri someth social commentari dive whole area topic fail i didnt expect come cinema i assum light funni movi instead i got speech patriarchi men world not say isnt someth would expect barbi movi market fun comedi moviedevelop charact non exist constantli chang mood person without explan
So fun!,"As a child of the 60s and early 70s, I grew up playing Barbies until I was almost 14. I couldn't wait to see this movie.Margot Robbie is a perfect Barbie. She's beautiful and brilliant. The Kens are great, with Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu giving outstanding performances. The settings are so good, and the costumes are amazing.I don't understand a lot of the viewers saying the movie is too preachy. I look at it as a satiric statement on society. There are so many parts of the movie that are laugh-out-loud funny.Barbie is a brilliant film for all ages. Watch this movie, and reminisce.

6.9 - better than what most people told me,"Yes its a Barbie which means it will be on par with the animated movies (having a lead character and the story revolving around her), but when I put it on my, the acquired humor caught me unexpectedly and the movie had a few high points and it somehow, for god knows what reasons, kept my interest.The conflict part which started when Ken was introduced to the men world was pure comedy. The whole KenLand was pure comedy and imo probably the best part.On the other hand, I also wasn't a fan of how they the BarbieLand was essentially controlled by you know who, but it was exactly the opposite of what happens in real world so yeah if what happens in the real world, being rules by men, is justifiable then yes BarbieLand practices are also right.On a whole a good small giggly movie but not worth a rewatch.",better peopl told,ye barbi mean par anim movi lead charact stori revolv around i put acquir humor caught unexpectedli movi high point somehow god know reason kept interestth conflict part start ken introduc men world pure comedi the whole kenland pure comedi imo probabl best parton hand i also wasnt fan barbieland essenti control know exactli opposit happen real world yeah happen real world rule men justifi ye barbieland practic also righton whole good small giggli movi worth rewatch
"Hit some right notes, missed othets","I saw the trailer & had higher hopes. Visually interesting, what would Barbie be like if she existed in her own pink world. Who is a Ken in that world.I like that she is having an existential crisis. Children can enjoy it while missing the Man woman dominance, feminist, maybe pick up on the Learn to be yourself theme.I like the fantasy surreal Barbie world and the real world. Some io it was murky. Mattel wants to keep Barbie in a box. Knowing that Barbie and Ken live in an alternate universe. They do mention that they don't have genitals.Margo & Ryan are the dolls come to life.As I understand, since Barbie was a grown up fashion doll, she had to have long legs & a tiny waist to dress her in tiny fashion outfits, not because they were pushing unreal body types.",hit right note miss othet,i saw trailer higher hope visual interest would barbi like exist pink world who ken worldi like existenti crisi child enjoy miss man woman domin feminist mayb pick learn themei like fantasi surreal barbi world real world some io murki mattel want keep barbi box know barbi ken live altern univers they mention dont genitalsmargo ryan doll come lifea i understand sinc barbi grown fashion doll long leg tini waist dress tini fashion outfit push unreal bodi type
"""Stereotypical Barbie"" in a Stereotypical Movie","First, the good bits. I thoroughly enjoyed the cast, even got to see some favorites in semi-major roles. For a blockbuster movie like this, good acting is to be expected. I also, as many fellow viewers pointed out, enjoyed the intricacies that made the movie seem like it was scripted by a kid. That was the whole point with the floating and dramatics-things that can only happen in imagination actually happen in the movie.Now, while I enjoyed the movie and didn't see it as preachy at all-in fact, I think it did a great job of saying what Barbie stood for if it wasn't a perfect woman no girl could become-it could've been better. The plot, while purposely childlike, seemed rushed and half-finished towards the end. Without going to a means of spoiling, I wished for better character development and realism in stead of useless scenes that did nothing but spotlight good looks and physique. This movie COULD'VE been a transformational experience along the lines of ""when perfect isn't good enough."" I really just got a couple rounds of laughs, some nods of approval, and mere silence looking at a movie that even it didn't know where it was going.TL;DR - It's a good movie-not a great movie.",stereotyp barbi stereotyp movi,first good bit i thoroughli enjoy cast even got see favorit semimajor role for blockbust movi like good act expect i also mani fellow viewer point enjoy intricaci made movi seem like script kid that whole point float dramaticsth happen imagin actual happen movienow i enjoy movi didnt see preachi allin fact i think great job say barbi stood wasnt perfect woman girl could becomeit couldv better the plot purpos childlik seem rush halffinish toward end without go mean spoil i wish better charact develop realism stead useless scene noth spotlight good look physiqu thi movi couldv transform experi along line perfect isnt good enough i realli got coupl round laugh nod approv mere silenc look movi even didnt know goingtldr it good movienot great movi
Barbie a Must See,"This movie is AWESOME! Unexpected in so many good ways. Addresses so many social issues and complicated conversations in a fun, fair, and thoughtful way. What a joyful blend of comedy, music, color and memories from childhood. Every frame is filled with so much visual candy, and if you ever owned a Barbie or Ken or skipper or Alan you will not be disappointed by the costumes or sets. The actors, editing, directing, writing and set design are a solid 10. I don't think the previews do this movie justice, it was so much more than I expected.

It was fun... For a while longer than i though,"I loved how they translated the Barbieland from our imaginations tp screen. The clothes, colours and stages are beautifully done.The way they show stiff unbendable limbs are just such a simple detail, comical in a way but also sad and stiff. How can girls compare themselves to a unbendy, out of proportion, busty blonde. And in this case a Barbie without a true purpose. No one wants to be known as stereotypical... Thats just average...The story is fun. Barbie is having an existential crisis while Ken just needs a bit of love.I kept wondering what the *deep dive story* is all about. Is this a person playing with Barbies and Kens and just thinking ""what if""?The story may be about nothing important. Or it might showcase the strugles of the real world.Do girls still play with Barbie and does Ken even feature??The soundtrack is good.And i LOVE Weird Barbie but i dont think my Barbie would have made it in the movie, she was attacked by hooligans with toothpick spikes and she lost her head when the tried fitting her into King Solomons Mines (do you remember the) stewpot.....

Who exactly is the target audience for this film?,"Greta Gerwig has had a hit or miss career. Her film Little Women was fairly entertaining, but I found her film Lady Bird to be completely obnoxious. Same goes for Margot Robbie. I enjoyed her in Wolf Of Wall Street and Once Upon a Time In Hollywood, but really disliked I Tonya and Birds of Prey.Now comes Barbie, based on the long running series of dolls from Mattel. Now as a guy, I never played with Barbies prefering to play video games over dolls, however my sisters enjoyed playing them and that's the question about this film. Who is the target audience for this film? Because on one hand it looked like a film designed for sixty year old women who never got over playing with their dolls and on another hand, its advertising is aimed at little girls even though some of the material maybe offensive to a lot of families.The plotline, which is extremely thin, involves Barbie living the perfect life in Barbieland where Barbie dolls of all types live and where all the Kens hang out at the beach, Then all of a sudden Barbie escapes to the real world where she is treated like a dog really hammering home Greta Gerwig's misandry.I can see this film having a decent opening weekend but expect it to drop like a rock in the following weeks when people realize this film is really just a one trick pony. The pink sets look nice but the screenplay and the annoying script are definitely going to divide audiences and this film really doens't have mainstream appeal at all. Most of all Will Farrel as the CEO of Mattel is about as annoying as ever and the misanderyt stereotypes are about entertaining as watching paint dry.A one on a scale of 1-10.

Not flawless by any means but it does (k)enough to make its point,"Things I didn't like:
The over the board marketing and publicity (esp about the IP products)
Lack of subtlety.Feels too preachy at some points.The Mattel scenes were little too silly.Like:
Satire hits hard most of the time.Unapologetic and audacious approach.A Strong message and way it is delivered.The mother-daughter dynamics (at most times).Production design and color pallets.Margot Robbie and our guy Ryan almost perfectly playing their parts.Greta Gerwig's direction.Now onto some spoiler-y bit:I think most people just want to gets triggered without putting much thought behind this. They missed the main point.We have to remember that it is a satire and both the Barbie Land and Real World are extreme representations of polarity which is not what we need. I think it does well to deliver the message of why individuality is more important.Also I support how at the end how they didn't just give the Kens the equal status in the councils or whatever because at the end of the day at that very moment, in that fictional world the Barbies were more qualified (by design) to hold those positions and all the Kens have just been are side characters with no ""real"" talents other than being the eye candys to the Barbies. Upliftment on basis of gender and not merit/talent is never a sign of a healthy society . But from now onwards it will not be ""Barbie...and Ken"" but ""it's Barbie and it's Ken"". I think this was the first step towards that balanced and independent world.3.5/5 + 0.5 stars for the sheer audacity to bring forth such a daring topic at such a scale. It will be a 3rd/4th in my list of Greta Gerwig's work.",not flawless mean kenough make point,thing i didnt like the board market public esp ip product lack subtletyfeel preachi pointsth mattel scene littl sillylik satir hit hard timeunapologet audaci approacha strong messag way deliveredth motherdaught dynam timesproduct design color palletsmargot robbi guy ryan almost perfectli play partsgreta gerwig directionnow onto spoileri biti think peopl want get trigger without put much thought behind they miss main pointw rememb satir barbi land real world extrem represent polar need i think well deliv messag individu importantalso i support end didnt give ken equal statu council whatev end day moment fiction world barbi qualifi design hold posit ken side charact real talent eye candi barbi uplift basi gender merittal never sign healthi societi but onward barbieand ken barbi ken i think first step toward balanc independ world star sheer audac bring forth dare topic scale it rdth list greta gerwig work
Big mix of testosterone and oestrogen,"Barbie movie was alright. Some scenes were quite cringe and the movie was not that super funny after all. Jokes here and there were sexually but that was it. Nowadays, I believe it is a good thing that the characters in the movie are all people from color. What is still a mystery and confusing is how they left the Barbieworld to the real world and vice versa... Besides the storyline was sometimes random and out of the blue how things turned out. I wouldn't definitely watch this movie again. Though, I would watch it as a drinking game, whenever someone says Barbie you have to take a shot.

How does the Barbie movie have good ratings? How?!,"First, I can't believe I went to this movie. My 18 year old daughter wanted to go so I said ok. I watched the first 20 minutes in disbelief - with my internal voice asking, ""How did this movie ever get made?"" The story is stupid. The acting is bad. The movie tries to be a cross between The Wizard of Oz, La La Land, Being John Malkovich and The Truman Show but fails on all attempts. Is it a musical, comedy, drama, spoof? Yes to all. But again, it fails miserably on all attempts. Oh - and have I mentioned how we women are supposed to be superior to men? Like the Woo Girls in HIMYM, it's just sad. I'll never get my time or money back, so I recommend you just save your money and go see something else. I just can't believe this film has good reviews.

As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.Anyway, I embraced the journey and I'm glad that I did. Here is my review written as a prententious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:In Greta Gerwig's latest directorial venture, ""Barbie,"" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unraveling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig's live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie's role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I'm giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie.",best movi ive ever seen,got free ticket preview honest i littl embarrass go i tell soul a cool middl age gentleman word got could realli affect street credanyway i embrac journey im glad i here review written prententi critic i aspir next lifein greta gerwig latest directori ventur barbi esteem filmmak take monument task unravel enigma barbi icon doll fascin polar societi decadeswith margot robbi eponym charact ryan gosl ken gerwig liveact rendit delv complex world barbi attempt extract deeper mean cultur phenomenongerwig master navig treacher water brand materi infus narr blend adventur comedi fantasi romanc the result thoughtprovok explor barbi role feminist symbol challeng societ percept feminin girlhoodcan doll imposs perfect featur smile perpetu happi truli embodi feminist idealsgerwig compel audienc contempl question weav throughout fabric filmin realiti margot robbi domin film expect develop true cinemat icon the flm fun far expect henc im give boast i watch barbi

I'm guessing teenage airheads - the sort that happily equate a Barbie doll with the Nazi war machine, as is done in the film. Wow! If the aim was feminism, I'd call this an own goal. So whinging, so reliant on gender stereotypes and societal stereotypes, so busy sermonising, it achieves nothing. The reasoning behind the film's reasoning wouldn't stand up to two minutes of scrutiny. Who wrote this junk? Who directed it? Who signed it off?

Fun movie,"Barbie is, in its very core, a comedy, and a funny one at that. From the opening scene, Greta Gerwig set up the mood that will run thru the entire movie. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are both amazing, but the rest of the big ensemble is a mixed bag. This is mostly because of the writing. Will Ferrells character served no more purpose than advertise the Mattel company as goofy and ""self aware"". The third act slows the movie down, which is a shame as the first and second acts are very strong. However, when Barbie delivers it delivers. The set design are beautifully artificial.

Final third almost ruins it,"On the nose with so much - wasn't too heavy handed in its representation of fenmisim, the patriarchy or anything along those lines.However the final third, starting with the war of Ken sent this film into a bit of an anti-climatic ending. Enjoyed it massively up to that point and found it educational without being condisending. As a male especially, to understand the points this film makes it absolutely makes a difference and is eye opening.The cop out and 'realisation' Barbie makes at the very end is frankly a cop out, going against the trend of the entire film. Was frankly disappointed and felt it just ran out of ideas.Still Gerwig should be commended for her attempt to turn a Mattel product into a film filled with humour, social conscience, style and at the very least humour.Just a shame it was so badly let down towards the end.",final third almost ruin,on nose much wasnt heavi hand represent fenmisim patriarchi anyth along lineshowev final third start war ken sent film bit anticlimat end enjoy massiv point found educ without condisend a male especi understand point film make absolut make differ eye openingth cop realis barbi make end frankli cop go trend entir film wa frankli disappoint felt ran ideasstil gerwig commend attempt turn mattel product film fill humour social conscienc style least humourjust shame badli let toward end
Surprising and Full of Surprises,"As I said at the beginning of the article, I lost my expectations before watching the movie because of the trailers. It felt like they were going on a story, especially one that would end up with big problems in the future. I will continue to watch an average movie when the analogies made on the internet seem to confirm my suspicions. But Barbie is hiding with a pretty well-written script. He uses drama in the parts that should be serious, and humor in the parts. From that moment on, the script can be both preserved and conveyed to the audience much better. Moreover, when the editing is at a fluent pace, you watch the movie breathlessly. The fact that its duration is under two hours is also nice considering the length of mainstream movies in recent years.",surpris full surpris,a i said begin articl i lost expect watch movi trailer it felt like go stori especi one would end big problem futur i continu watch averag movi analog made internet seem confirm suspicion but barbi hide pretti wellwritten script he use drama part seriou humor part from moment script preserv convey audienc much better moreov edit fluent pace watch movi breathlessli the fact durat two hour also nice consid length mainstream movi recent year

"Literally the worst movie I have ever seen. (OK, maybe some preachy religious movies are worse, I give you that)","You know that saying, ""show, don't tell""?Well, somebody should inform the screenwriters.This film literally has a narrator to introduce you to the plot by describing things.The characters are there just to have them say what the screenwriters want to yell to the world: Unfortunately, that is just a distorted view of reality a never-ending, self-righteous adolescent-level commentary on social issues the writers clearly have little grasp on, but are nevertheless very upset about.And the best part? The writers are so pompous that they literally thing that ""listening to their preachy tantrums (voiced by the actors in the movie), is all that it takes to ""wake people up"" and emancipate them.If only we had the writers's wisdom sooner as a
Humankind, all wrongs would have been avoided /s.But the thing that really solidified the incompetence of the script, is the ""4th wall breaking"", acknowledging that Margot Robbie is too beautiful to be portraying someone that would be saying what is being said.Kind of meta, the writers realizing their failing script, but instead of improving it, they think that acknowledging the fact somehow makes it OK and smart.I literally became dumber by watching this two hour high-school essay written by ""adults"" who think they know what's wrong in the world, but actually lack the basic mental capacity to recognize their naive worldview and incompetence.",liter worst movi i ever seen ok mayb preachi religi movi wors i give,you know say show dont tellwel somebodi inform screenwritersthi film liter narrat introduc plot describ thingsth charact say screenwrit want yell world unfortun distort view realiti neverend selfright adolescentlevel commentari social issu writer clearli littl grasp nevertheless upset aboutand best part the writer pompou liter thing listen preachi tantrum voic actor movi take wake peopl emancip themif writer wisdom sooner humankind wrong would avoid sbut thing realli solidifi incompet script th wall break acknowledg margot robbi beauti portray someon would say saidkind meta writer realiz fail script instead improv think acknowledg fact somehow make ok smarti liter becam dumber watch two hour highschool essay written adult think know what wrong world actual lack basic mental capac recogn naiv worldview incompet

"Barbie... Better than I thought, but fell a little short","Scoreboard:Overall Score: 6.7/10Storyline/Plot: 6.8/10Acting: 8/10Directing: 7/10Ending: 7/10Cinematography: 6.5/10Comedy: 6.8/10Action: 5.9/10Overall Review:Firstly, in all my years of being a Cinema Connoisseur, it is rare to see a movie sell out as quickly and widespread as Barbie. So well done to the Barbie marketing team!I walked in the cinema with no expectations, but I have to say I was overall pleasantly surprised with Barbie. I thought it might be the usual run of the mill silly kids movie, with a completely unserious/unrealistic storyline.However, the Barbie storyline touched on a lot of serious real world issues and situations that many people can relate to. With that said, it did feel like a senseless musical at times, with unesscessary sing/dance scenes.The essence of the film touches on the juxtaposition of what life would be like if women ruled the world (Barbie Land). And the real world we live in, which is male dominated. This was portrayed well, but did get abit too silly sometimes.The level of acting from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, were both bang on. Considering they were playing dolls, they kept a great balance between having to act silly, whilst still keeping a level of seriousness, so the sillyness doesn't go overboard.Overall, ""Barbie"" was actually a decent watch with a good level of comedy and realism, whilst keeping the essence of what Barbie represents.Isit worth a watch?...

Pretentious Pink Plastic,"So much ink already spilled for this film and the two camps firmly entrenched between those who thought it was heavy handed and those who felt emotions and therefore believe it was a masterpiece.I'll give a third option, that the movie was well executed in terms of vision and design and that was it. The political messaging dips into 1970s third wave and the ""real"" world reflects these outdated moores in abundance. That will polarize any audience I suppose.Maybe there was some deeper meaning through the parody but in reality I think emotional reasoning and cognitive bias are the real culprits of the director's world view.This movie was cotton candy, very sweet, sort of sticky and gross, and very quick to disolve and leave your digestive track.",pretenti pink plastic,so much ink alreadi spill film two camp firmli entrench thought heavi hand felt emot therefor believ masterpieceil give third option movi well execut term vision design the polit messag dip third wave real world reflect outdat moor abund that polar audienc i supposemayb deeper mean parodi realiti i think emot reason cognit bia real culprit director world viewthi movi cotton candi sweet sort sticki gross quick disolv leav digest track
this is the movie of humanity,"I watched this over the weekend and I can say downright that all the media attention and acclaim this movie has received is all truthful. This is a dark-gritty, wholesome and unconventionally humorous film that creates a dark and twisted yet fantastical and feminine adjunction towards the brand and the key themes it lays upon, themes of feminism, social roles, corporate greed, aging, legacies and divine intervention. It reads like a piece from epic poetry, as if the gods themselves had come down and made it. This is definitely the movie of 2023, and the wide range of actors just make it more convincing, I had my boyfriend drooling over ryan reynolds for the duration of the movie and I loved Margot Robbie's take on barbie.

Everyone interacted with the movie by cheering and clapping throughout. After the movie was over everyone was so uplifted that chatting in the lobby was actually a thing between strangers. That's a lot to get from a little movie about a small doll. I told my husband on the way home we will have to find a karaoke version of a song that Ken sings but not necessarily the one that Barbie does. Will Ferrell was unexpected and as always completely enjoyable.",see theater,the movi fun silli entertain saw theater first time ive one sinc peopl includ dress everyon interact movi cheer clap throughout after movi everyon uplift chat lobbi actual thing stranger that lot get littl movi small doll i told husband way home find karaok version song ken sing necessarili one barbi will ferrel unexpect alway complet enjoy

It's Actually Fun to Be in a Barbie World,"Going into Barbie with having little to no expectations at all can be such a delight.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's banter with one another, even when they are on their own, are so entertaining to look at, especially Gosling who seems to have a more fun in the movie and is indeed the funniest out of all the cast members.That being said, everyone in the cast seem to be having fun in their own respective roles, living out Barbieland and the real world. But by far the standout would have to Kate McKinnon (Ghostbusters) and America Ferrera (How To Train Your Dragon), who both help Robbie's titular character when she is having an existential crisis.As for the production design, it is without a doubt, the strongest aspect of the film, particularly in BarbieLand where it seemed like the production team really went all-out in making the world, not to mention how they really feel when young girls are playing with Barbie.The film does carry a lot of themes of not just someone trying to overcome an identity loss but also how acceptance should start by loving yourself and not needing to live up to the norms set up by leaders.They are thought-provoking including capitalist feminism (how ideas can make money instead of enjoyment), alongside the idea of growing up which is coming to terms with reality and letting go of the childhood you have cherished - which is well-represented in the fantasy and real world.All the way through, as a comedy, even though some jokes did not land well, most of it are really funny and does put a smile on your face up until the very end.Overall, Barbie continues to prove the amazing directing skills of Greta Gerwig (Little Women, Lady Bird) and alongside her writing craft with her husband Noah Baumbach. With this film alongside Oppenheimer, it is one of the standout films of 2023.",it actual fun be barbi world,go barbi littl expect delightmargot robbi ryan gosl banter one anoth even entertain look especi gosl seem fun movi inde funniest cast membersthat said everyon cast seem fun respect role live barbieland real world but far standout would kate mckinnon ghostbust america ferrera how to train your dragon help robbi titular charact existenti crisisa product design without doubt strongest aspect film particularli barbieland seem like product team realli went allout make world mention realli feel young girl play barbieth film carri lot theme someon tri overcom ident loss also accept start love need live norm set leadersthey thoughtprovok includ capitalist femin idea make money instead enjoy alongsid idea grow come term realiti let go childhood cherish wellrepres fantasi real worldal way comedi even though joke land well realli funni put smile face endoveral barbi continu prove amaz direct skill greta gerwig littl woman ladi bird alongsid write craft husband noah baumbach with film alongsid oppenheim one standout film
"It's good, but overrated","It's a good movie, worth the watch but nothing special. It was really overhyped worldwide and although it's a good movie, it's nothing special. I believe standards have gone up in recent times and movies are getting better, and this is below that. However it tells an important story, and is a somewhat fun and education movie. I would rate it 6.5-7/10. Even though it's a ""Barbie"" movie, kids under probably 13 wouldn't understand the movie well. The moral of the story isn't just Barbie's and their fun little world. It's somewhat serious, and kids would only see the Barbie part, and not understand the point of the movie.",it good overr,it good movi worth watch noth special it realli overhyp worldwid although good movi noth special i believ standard gone recent time movi get better howev tell import stori somewhat fun educ movi i would rate even though barbi movi kid probabl wouldnt understand movi well the moral stori isnt barbi fun littl world it somewhat seriou kid would see barbi part understand point movi

Beautifully done movie,"I have never felt move validated as a woman as when I watched this film. It is so beautiful and meaningful while also being witty and funny, this is what a movie is supposed to be. You are supposed to be on the verge of tears and the next minute laughing, it's an experience. Although men will watch this and enjoy it, they won't understand it or how validating it is as a woman to watch. This movie was something I hope every little girl will watch and every woman will watch so she can feel validated. This movie is so meaningful and I hope people will see behind the glitz and glamour and see the sentiment behind it. I'm so happy this movie has been created and I've never watched a film that so beautifully shows how complex it is to be a woman and how the patriarchy damages everyone in it but mostly women. It was deeper that barbie and pink and silly. It's also interesting how the dialogue is from a child's perspective of playing with a doll. It took me back to being little and playing with my dolls and thinking anything was possible and not feeling guilty about liking girly stuff, or wearing pink. So well done and definitely a conversation starter.

"Not riveting, but good","Honestly I loved it. The colors were brilliant. The usage of popular artists and actors as really well done. All of the characters were brilliantly casted. The it was intriguing, and generally attriactive for both young and mature audiences. I think because of this though, it just didn't hit as hard for me. The messages within the movie were quite profound, and many of my friends ended up emotional due to its relatability and the fact that nothing actually changed at the end. Good overall, stellar for younger audiences, and would 100% recommend to a younger child. Not my color palette, so it was a bit bright. Not riveting.

Barbie&Ken,"The marketing for this movie was seriously unlike anything else Billie Eillish, Xbox, Aldo, Burger King? Nyx, Forever 21, google etc.It had a LOT of adult concepts and words that would go right over the kiddos heads (gynecologist, patriarchy, genitals, ""beaching each other off"") honestly i don't think small children would enjoy it much. It was definitely more for teens and adults (PG13) it had a lot of great comedy. I liked seeing Barbieland ran by women in strong leadership positions and think the ken dolls were fun depicted as accessories/ kinda lost without Barbie. It was cool to have a deep realistic spin on it but it's just not a feel good movie like I had hoped since they had Ken be so angry the whole movie, all the creepy men and the constant crying and anxiety from Barbie . We were in the existential anxiety part for most of the movie which made the happy ending feel super rushed.I think my low review has to do with the fact that we live through all the body image issues and sexism gender role stuff it's nice to take a break and watch a light hearted movie every once in a while.",barbieken,the market movi serious unlik anyth el billi eillish xbox aldo burger king nyx forev googl etcit lot adult concept word would go right kiddo head gynecologist patriarchi genit beach honestli dont think small child would enjoy much it definit teen adult pg lot great comedi i like see barbieland ran woman strong leadership posit think ken doll fun depict accessori kinda lost without barbi it cool deep realist spin feel good movi like i hope sinc ken angri whole movi creepi men constant cri anxieti barbi we existenti anxieti part movi made happi end feel super rushedi think low review fact live bodi imag issu sexism gender role stuff nice take break watch light heart movi everi
"Pleasantly surprising piece of work, and a deserved hit","STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulBarbie (Margot Robbie) is one of the many Barbies living in Barbieland, living a happy, carefree life partying and living it up with her friends, in spite of everyone holding down top positions in demanding roles. Suddenly, she suffers an existential crisis, wondering about death, caused by her owner, fifteen year old Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt.) In order to sort it out, she must travel to the real world and connect with her owner, only for Ken (Ryan Gosling) to hitch a ride along with her. On arrival, Barbie is rejected by her owner, and discovers a world where men rule, which Ken is enamoured by. Upon their return to Barbieland, he uses this model to take over, thrusting Barbie into a desperate battle to regain control, and discover the true nature of things in the process.When it was first released back in the summer, there was a furore around the Barbie movie, as it was released at the same time as the Oppenheimer film, and there was a big uproar about which film was going to win at the box office, with some medical experts even concerned the crowds soaring to see both films would make the Covid numbers go up again. Thankfully, that didn't appear to have been the case, but while both films have been phenomenally successful, Barbie has gone on to be the most successful film of the year, and now I've finally got round to seeing it. And, given it was inevitable that I eventually would, I can say I'm quite glad I did.It was easy enough from the very beginning to dismiss, just from the premise (a film about Barbie dolls, now?) and the central premise does feel a bit flimsy to begin with, but it does gradually develop into something more substantial and affecting, with a moving and engaging story about self discovery. Another bugbear to quash is the film's apparent 'hatred of men.' While the themes do revolve around the patriarchy and toxic masculinity, it does also address the issues of emasculation and gender norms expected of men to live up to, and its all done in such a jovial, non preachy way that it's very unlikely to really rub anyone up the wrong way.From a premise so fluffy comes something so much more multilayered, a far fetched conception that addresses much deeper issues, with a touching undercurrent and a generally fun, funky nature, with a more than decent soundtrack (not including the much despised 90's Aqua tune.) ****",pleasantli surpris piec work deserv hit,star rate brilliant veri good okay poor awfulbarbi margot robbi one mani barbi live barbieland live happi carefre life parti live friend spite everyon hold top posit demand role suddenli suffer existenti crisi wonder death caus owner fifteen year old sasha ariana greenblatt in order sort must travel real world connect owner ken ryan gosl hitch ride along on arriv barbi reject owner discov world men rule ken enamour upon return barbieland use model take thrust barbi desper battl regain control discov true natur thing processwhen first releas back summer furor around barbi movi releas time oppenheim film big uproar film go win box offic medic expert even concern crowd soar see film would make covid number go thank didnt appear case film phenomen success barbi gone success film year ive final got round see and given inevit i eventu would i say im quit glad i didit easi enough begin dismiss premis film barbi doll central premis feel bit flimsi begin gradual develop someth substanti affect move engag stori self discoveri anoth bugbear quash film appar hatr men while theme revolv around patriarchi toxic masculin also address issu emascul gender norm expect men live done jovial non preachi way unlik realli rub anyon wrong wayfrom premis fluffi come someth much multilay far fetch concept address much deeper issu touch undercurr gener fun funki natur decent soundtrack includ much despis aqua tune
Spoiler-Free Unbiased Review,"Barbie is a film that on the outside appeals to a younger audience but it is certainly much more mature in overall nature.Barbie pushes the boundaries of what a people blindly may assume a Barbie movie should or would be able to- in both good ways, and bad ways.The good- Barbie is at many moments, fun, adaptive, emotional, even philosophically provoking. The story is enjoyable and attention-grabbing while both Gosling and Robbie have played their roles to a T. Margot Robbie played the ""stereotypical Barbie"" so well, almost too well at times. Ryan Gosling played Ken so well and the contrast between him in two different arcs of the film were not only distinct but all-believable. The costume design was superb and I was thoroughly impressed with some of the visuals and set design throughout. The CGI is very poor at a few scenes (which normally I would put under cons) BUT the film doesn't take its self too seriously during those scenes, so it's rather comical than anything.The bad- The writing of this film contains certain elements of contradiction; It essentially claims that women can (mostly) only be powerful by holding ""high societal job responsibilities,"" such as being a lawyer, doctor, president, etc; when this just simply isn't true, MOTHERS FOR EXAMPLE! Being a mother is one of (if not the biggest) responsibility a human can have- the idea of a collective job that can single handedly shift an entire generations thinking? Yeah, sorry but mother's are the most powerful. The film at several moments gets very political but subliminally and not-subliminally, which is always annoying no matter what political beliefs you carry, it's just almost always cringe I guess?TLDR;
""Barbie"" triumphs in being fun, engaging, and thought-provoking. The film, like many others, sells itself short by its political agenda and removes depth by doing so. Overall a mostly enjoyable experience meant for an adult audience.7.3/10.",spoilerfre unbias review,barbi film outsid appeal younger audienc certainli much matur overal naturebarbi push boundari peopl blindli may assum barbi movi would abl good way bad waysth good barbi mani moment fun adapt emot even philosoph provok the stori enjoy attentiongrab gosl robbi play role t margot robbi play stereotyp barbi well almost well time ryan gosl play ken well contrast two differ arc film distinct allbeliev the costum design superb i thoroughli impress visual set design throughout the cgi poor scene normal i would put con but film doesnt take self serious scene rather comic anythingth bad the write film contain certain element contradict it essenti claim woman mostli power hold high societ job respons lawyer doctor presid etc simpli isnt true mother for exampl be mother one biggest respons human idea collect job singl handedli shift entir gener think yeah sorri mother power the film sever moment get polit sublimin notsublimin alway annoy matter polit belief carri almost alway cring i guesstldr barbi triumph fun engag thoughtprovok the film like mani other sell short polit agenda remov depth overal mostli enjoy experi meant adult audienc

"Ok-ish, not spectacular","I was prepared to hate it but it turned out it's not that bad. But let's not confuse it with an award worthy film. It's not that great... I think they had a message in mind but they kind of butchered it. On the other hand, Ryan Gosling gave us a performance, he's a really good actor, even if the caracter was a little ridiculous. It was fun (and funny) to see a 40 something year old man play a character like that and I have to give it to him.. he nailed it.Overall it's an inoffensive movie you can watch when you don't have anything else better to do.

And it's not fair for anyone on either side.This film isn't just about feminism or female empowerment, it's about growing up and finding who you really are, and what is your actual purpose.

Better Than Expected . . . Still Not Great,"Barbie provided the ying to Oppenheimer's yang. It was significantly better than I anticipated due to it's artistic filming, fun casting, and plot. I expected a 3/10 and it was twice as nice, coming in at a solid 6/10.What to like: The sets were a fun mix of real word items and ""Barbified"" backdrops/objects. This quickly normalized the weird blend of a live-action movie based on a toy. The star-studded cast was fantastic! It was fun to watch so many familiar faces in such silly roles.What not to like: The part where Barbie failed was in it's preachiness. I'm fine with films having an underlying message- and I even agree with the overall message it seems Barbie was trying to make. America Ferrera's rant towards the end was a bit too heavy/angry for me and made it seem that women had cornered the market on every hardship imaginable. This angry turn made the movie far less fun.",better than expect still not great,barbi provid ying oppenheim yang it significantli better i anticip due artist film fun cast plot i expect twice nice come solid what like the set fun mix real word item barbifi backdropsobject thi quickli normal weird blend liveact movi base toy the starstud cast fantast it fun watch mani familiar face silli roleswhat like the part barbi fail preachi im fine film underli messag i even agre overal messag seem barbi tri make america ferrera rant toward end bit heavyangri made seem woman corner market everi hardship imagin thi angri turn made movi far le fun
Don't believe the hype,"Rarely have I seen a film that can be so heavy handed with its messaging and at others totally confusing.

A fantastic satirical drama of patriarchy,"A fantastic satirical drama on patriarchy blended with witty humor, fabulous direction, and fabulous acting.It can be many things, but not a kids' film or gender-specific film.Greta takes us into fantasy barbieland with the deep concepts of consumerism, patriarcy, physical insecurity, and self-discovery cleverly layered under it.Conveys all these in a satirical and humorous way subtly and beautifully.I loved how it shows both extremes of patriarchy of men and also women.The sets, visuals, music, and costumes were just so amazing sets the whole vibe.Ken and Barbie had such awesome chemistry and genreated great humor on the screen.I was so excited to see margot robbie & emma mackey together in the film. And they were fantastic.

So many messages. Congrats,"It's impressive how so many messages were cleverly conveyed through a well-known brand.The movie addressed a range of great themes, skillfully communicated through colors and a cute fairytale-like presentation.-One of the key messages is when Barbie talks to Ken in the end and her words focus mostly on the fact that individuals should find their completeness within themselves before entering a relationship. Exploring personal preferences and self-awareness is vital before projecting unresolved issues onto a partnership. Developing a strong self-relationship is a foundational step before building connections with others.-The movie also transforms the traditional Barbie world to a world where men pursue their interests while Barbies serve them. This shift seems to show the challenge of achieving equality in relationships, highlighting the struggle to establish and maintain balance between feminism and patriarchy.-A particularly touching moment is Barbie creator's monologue. It resonates as an empowerment boost for women who stay in abusive situations due to their lack of self-confidence and fear of taking control of their lives.-The film addresses also how society imposes unrealistic role models, leading to personal dissatisfaction. Barbie has been/still is an example of those models. However, if our real lives start being reflected into the doll, we will notice how miserable and depressing we all are.It's sad to see negative reviews for this impactful attempt that managed to encapsulate these messages.",so mani messag congrat,it impress mani messag cleverli convey wellknown brandth movi address rang great theme skill commun color cute fairytalelik presentationon key messag barbi talk ken end word focu mostli fact individu find complet within enter relationship explor person prefer selfawar vital project unresolv issu onto partnership develop strong selfrelationship foundat step build connect othersth movi also transform tradit barbi world world men pursu interest barbi serv thi shift seem show challeng achiev equal relationship highlight struggl establish maintain balanc femin patriarchya particularli touch moment barbi creator monologu it reson empower boost woman stay abus situat due lack selfconfid fear take control livesth film address also societi impos unrealist role model lead person dissatisfact barbi beenstil exampl model howev real live start reflect doll notic miser depress areit sad see neg review impact attempt manag encapsul messag
"My first thought was, I didn't love it but I didn't hate it","I genuinely had planned to give the movie a 5 because it wasn't bad but it wasn't good but then the longer I have had to think after the movie I still feel that way but also like the movie was a waste of time and money. I really had hoped it was going to be amazing!! It is Barbie for crying out loud. And while I have never been a huge fan of playing with them, they are iconic. I also felt they cast Ken and Barbie perfectly. However the movie made little sense, their are no really good amazing lines to quote, and the ending was blah. It wasn't very fun or funny either. So I decided it gets a 2 instead of a five.",my first thought i didnt love i didnt hate,i genuin plan give movi wasnt bad wasnt good longer i think movi i still feel way also like movi wast time money i realli hope go amaz it barbi cri loud and i never huge fan play icon i also felt cast ken barbi perfectli howev movi made littl sen realli good amaz line quot end blah it wasnt fun funni either so i decid get instead five
New concept,"Iconic. The set, the outfits, the decor, the styling was iconic. I loved that the words and tones they used were as if a child was playing with them, but the topics were more serious and meaningful. They gave such a creative and fun spin to everything. I had many moments where I thought ""how did they even come up with all of this"". I like to be positively surprised in a movie and the conversations and jokes were so fun and fitting to the movie and the vibe, everything was well thought of and I could not help but smile every time.

Barbie is a pretty fun movie to watch and worth the hype.,"As soon as the first teaser trailer dropped on YouTube for Barbie, it captured my attention and admiration for it recreated the ""Dawn of Men"" sequence from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey in a very creative and classic way. The hype of that one minute long clip, featuring (my celebrity crush) Margot Robbie who steals the show no matter what movie or role she is in, had me believing that this movie would be phenomenal. And over the course of several months until today, my expectations for this movie got bigger and bigger. This is partly thanks to the Barbenheimer online phenomenon which I followed and watched the both movies on the same opening day.Honestly, I didn't get everything I expected and I cannot say what I got is better than what I had expected. However, 2 hours of my time in front of that huge screen was pretty fun because Barbie is simply a very fun movie to watch and I absolutely loved it. I believe this is thanks to the feeling of watching it on the big screen with a bunch of strangers around to laugh with. I will definitely watch the movie again upon the digital release to try to prove myself wrong.Margot Robbie is, as always, phenomenal in the movie. Her incredible talent and charm carries almost the entire film, not to mention that she is a co-producer. She is not the best casting choice to play a Barbie doll but in this particular Barbie movie, she was born for the role. Her co-star Ryan Gosling is the comedic heart of the movie. Without him, the movie would certainly not be as fun as it is. The rest of the cast also compliment their roles fairly well, playing iconic characters and dolls of different races and sizes.I was expecting a longer, a more serious and elaborate plot for Barbie but what I got instead is not too bad. The movie clearly carries a message and that message is clearly conveyed through a plot that is brief and basically easy to understand which is built up in a favorable way.The production design and the costume design is certainly a huge part of the film. All the costumes, sets, props and everything look and feel so compelling and, most important of all, accurate to the overall history and legacy of Barbie and Mattel. I hugely respect that attention to detail.At the end of the day, Barbie is a movie I have been impatiently waiting for a long time and that I feel honored to have seen today on the opening day. It is a beautiful work of art paying beautiful homage to the legacy of it's origins and I am happy that I started loving this movie way before its release . . .",barbi pretti fun movi watch worth hype,a soon first teaser trailer drop youtub barbi captur attent admir recreat dawn men sequenc stanley kubrick a space odyssey creativ classic way the hype one minut long clip featur celebr crush margot robbi steal show matter movi role believ movi would phenomen and cours sever month today expect movi got bigger bigger thi partli thank barbenheim onlin phenomenon i follow watch movi open dayhonestli i didnt get everyth i expect i say i got better i expect howev hour time front huge screen pretti fun barbi simpli fun movi watch i absolut love i believ thank feel watch big screen bunch stranger around laugh i definit watch movi upon digit releas tri prove wrongmargot robbi alway phenomen movi her incred talent charm carri almost entir film mention coproduc she best cast choic play barbi doll particular barbi movi born role her costar ryan gosl comed heart movi without movi would certainli fun the rest cast also compliment role fairli well play icon charact doll differ race sizesi expect longer seriou elabor plot barbi i got instead bad the movi clearli carri messag messag clearli convey plot brief basic easi understand built favor wayth product design costum design certainli huge part film all costum set prop everyth look feel compel import accur overal histori legaci barbi mattel i huge respect attent detailat end day barbi movi i impati wait long time i feel honor seen today open day it beauti work art pay beauti homag legaci origin i happi i start love movi way releas

"The Beautiful and Though Provoking Feminism of ""Barbie""","Walking into the theater I was expecting a silly, outrageous, fun contrast to the competing new release of ""Oppenheimer"", but instead I found much more. Not only did this movie have incredible humor, but a deep insight to what it means to be a woman. The light it brought to the deep connection to mother's and daughters...especially the moment shared between Margot Robbie and Ruth Handler, was nothing short of a tear-jerker. Not only that, but the wide spectrum of representation of connection between women was remarkable; from the shared struggle of patriarchal restraints we experience to the common childhood memories of playing with dolls. I have seen some critics who hate magic, fun, and women, be quick to hate on the heavy speech America Ferrera gives in the third act about standards women must meet. Sure, it didn't fit the theme of Barbieland's perfect, pink atmosphere, but it was a powerful message needed to strengthen the impact of the movie. Her message was followed by an applause by the audience of the theater I was in.I left the theater in awe of how incredible this movie was and how incredible this movie made me feel. It spoke to me in ways that cheesy, ""relatable"", lazily anti-capitalist and cheap feminist media could never do. This movie is brilliant and inspiring for young girls such as myself. I felt loved and seen throughout this whole movie and felt so strongly about it I went through the hassle of making a damn IMDB account and writing an essay that wasn't required by a teacher or school project. I actually felt the need to share how this movie impacted me instead of letting the horse loving Ken's of the world speak over the women who felt a real connection to this movie. It is beautiful and a must watch.",the beauti though provok femin barbi,walk theater i expect silli outrag fun contrast compet new releas oppenheim instead i found much not movi incred humor deep insight mean woman the light brought deep connect mother daughtersespeci moment share margot robbi ruth handler noth short tearjerk not wide spectrum represent connect woman remark share struggl patriarch restraint experi common childhood memori play doll i seen critic hate magic fun woman quick hate heavi speech america ferrera give third act standard woman must meet sure didnt fit theme barbieland perfect pink atmospher power messag need strengthen impact movi her messag follow applaus audienc theater i ini left theater awe incred movi incred movi made feel it spoke way cheesi relat lazili anticapitalist cheap feminist medium could never thi movi brilliant inspir young girl i felt love seen throughout whole movi felt strongli i went hassl make damn imdb account write essay wasnt requir teacher school project i actual felt need share movi impact instead let hors love ken world speak woman felt real connect movi it beauti must watch
"Great comedy movie, not much else.","7.5/10: VERY GOODThis movie is very strange, but also very fun, it is well crafted, well acted and the humour is amazing. But where this movie fails is when it tries to make itself seem like a very important movie (in some parts) when the overall tone is light-hearted comedy. The scenes when it is trying to prove that also seem overlong. But, those scenes are funny, as is the rest of the film. I also enjoyed the direction it took with this not really being a children's film.Overall, i really enjoyed this movie, it has great humour, and great performances, but some scenes go on for too long. A very good and funny film.",great comedi movi much el,veri goodthi movi strang also fun well craft well act humour amaz but movi fail tri make seem like import movi part overal tone lightheart comedi the scene tri prove also seem overlong but scene funni rest film i also enjoy direct took realli child filmoveral realli enjoy movi great humour great perform scene go long a good funni film
I hated Barbie. Now there is the film poster in my room.,"I have never been a fan of Barbie: I found her too pink, too clichéd - until I watched this film. As the trailer suggested, this movie is for people who hate the legendary doll, so I gave it a shot. It was worth it: I seldom had that much fun in cinema.Barbie lives her happy life in Barbieland, but as she develops a human consciousness, she has to travel to the real world in order to restore normality.This movie is so much more than just funny, as it is political and not predictable. It discusses the influence of the doll on young girls: It criticizes Barbie's stereotypical body while acknowledging her for revolutionizing the way girls saw themselves.""Because Barbie can be anything, girls can be anything"" is said throughout the film. As Barbie taught girls to be more than just mothers, this is true.Margot Robbie has proved what a great actress she is. That makes her the perfect cast for Barbie, as you take her seriously and sympathize with her. Ryan Gosling as her counterpart is equally fitting. He provides the film with a great sense of humor that will leave you laughing out loud.All in all, ""Barbie"" differs from the majority of movies that are produced in Hollywood right now, as it is refreshingly new, funny and surprising. Director and author Greta Gerwig has done a great job creating this hilarious summer movie.",i hate barbi now film poster room,i never fan barbi i found pink clichd i watch film a trailer suggest movi peopl hate legendari doll i gave shot it worth i seldom much fun cinemabarbi live happi life barbieland develop human conscious travel real world order restor normalitythi movi much funni polit predict it discus influenc doll young girl it critic barbi stereotyp bodi acknowledg revolution way girl saw themselvesbecaus barbi anyth girl anyth said throughout film a barbi taught girl mother truemargot robbi prove great actress that make perfect cast barbi take serious sympath ryan gosl counterpart equal fit he provid film great sen humor leav laugh loudal barbi differ major movi produc hollywood right refreshingli new funni surpris director author greta gerwig done great job creat hilari summer movi

Characters popping up from left and right exuding glitter and delight! The movie was all-around Barbie to the maximum even through the outfits!(Women are powerful and can make a change) The message was...stated...kind of...I think so...? The movie did not put it really out there. There were many moments that made you stop and say ""huh?"" as well as insert that awkward laugh you give when your nan/gramps/great aunt/kid says something they really shouldn't have said, or known, outloud. It gave me the feel of ""I Feel Pretty""; movie with the intention of getting a message across, but never really gets it there. Even the ending made me say ""Are you serious?""Overall, if you are looking for a movie with a good time, this one can be it.

Not so Jolly Dolly,"So, last weekend my wife and I watched the Oppen part of the ""Barbenheimer"" 2023 box-office two-headed monster and this week it was Barbie's turn. From the little I'd incidentally read in advance about the day-glo billion dollar blockbuster, I was expecting some kind of retro-cool, existentialist, post-modernist satire on the battle of the sexes, consumerism and childhood buffed up with a little diversity along the way, but somehow with all these ducks lined up in a row, I felt the film missed the mark.It starts brightly with eye-candy sets in fifty shades of pink as we're introduced to Margot Robbie's Barbie in her Barbie-world of alternative Barbies, see through doll's houses and their various incomplete consumer goods, for example our girl has her daily dry-shower and drinks non-existent tea. Everything appears to be perfect in her / their perfect world, unless you're the boyfriend Ken, here also in a variety of forms, all doomed to exist only in Barbie's slipstream and so experience recurring frustration at getting precisely nowhere, all the time, with the object of his / their, I hesitate to call it, desire.Then things start to go wrong for Robbie's ""Stereotypical"" Barbie. She thinks of death and starts to malfunction and after a visit to Kate McKinnon's Weird Barbie, a concept I have to say I didn't get at all, she determines to go to the real world to connect with the disillusioned Mattel employee, played by America Ferrera, whose negativity, channelled through her disinterested daughter Ariana Greenblatt, is upsetting the living doll's equilibrium. Ryan Gosling's wheedling Ken is also along for the ride and stows away in her Penelope Pitstop-mobile and together they head for L. A., where Ferrera lives, the headquarters of the manufacturer Mattel.For me, the film went downhill fast from there with Ken's head getting messed-up with perceptions of patriarchy while Barbie has a meltdown over her identity-crisis. There are unfunny, over-played scenes where Barbie experiences humiliation at the hands of Greenblatt and her school chums, traipses down to Mattel HQ to confront the all-male board of directors headed by a mis-cast Will Ferrell as the company CEO, before returning to Barbie-world with Ferrera and Greenblatt in tow to take down Ken's new-model Kendom where outdated male-superiority is literally back in the saddle.I have to admit, I got very bored, very soon with this empty, supposedly satirical high-concept, fantasy-comedy. A world box-office of 1.5 billion dollars and eight Oscar nominations actually makes me wonder if I've not switched places too with Barbie-world as I'm afraid nothing about the movie, including the soundtrack and unsuccessful attempts at either comedy or pathos (especially when they wheel in Rhea Perlman as the doll's now-enlightened creator) all missing me by miles.When at one point, all her namesakes shout ""Go Barbie!', I must admit I was with them 100% but for completely different reasons.",not jolli dolli,so last weekend wife i watch oppen part barbenheim boxoffic twohead monster week barbi turn from littl id incident read advanc dayglo billion dollar blockbust i expect kind retrocool existentialist postmodernist satir battl sex consumer childhood buf littl diver along way somehow duck line row i felt film miss markit start brightli eyecandi set fifti shade pink introduc margot robbi barbi barbieworld altern barbi see doll hous variou incomplet consum good exampl girl daili dryshow drink nonexist tea everyth appear perfect perfect world unless your boyfriend ken also varieti form doom exist barbi slipstream experi recur frustrat get precis nowher time object i hesit call desirethen thing start go wrong robbi stereotyp barbi she think death start malfunct visit kate mckinnon weird barbi concept i say i didnt get determin go real world connect disillus mattel employe play america ferrera whose neg channel disinterest daughter ariana greenblatt upset live doll equilibrium ryan gosl wheedl ken also along ride stow away penelop pitstopmobil togeth head l a ferrera live headquart manufactur mattelfor film went downhil fast ken head get messedup percept patriarchi barbi meltdown identitycrisi there unfunni overplay scene barbi experi humili hand greenblatt school chum traips mattel hq confront allmal board director head miscast will ferrel compani ceo return barbieworld ferrera greenblatt tow take ken newmodel kendom outdat malesuperior liter back saddlei admit i got bore soon empti supposedli satir highconcept fantasycomedi a world boxoffic billion dollar eight oscar nomin actual make wonder ive switch place barbieworld im afraid noth movi includ soundtrack unsuccess attempt either comedi patho especi wheel rhea perlman doll nowenlighten creator miss mileswhen one point namesak shout go barbi i must admit i complet differ reason
A masterpiece made by women for women.,"Barbie will be a pioneer and a classic in the film world. She shatters all expectations and supersedes all standards. She is incredibly insightful, touching, truthful, whimsical. Barbie is made by women for women. To any man who ""doesn't get it"", you wont, but I invite you to watch it anyways as a show of support to women and our lived experiences and our dreams and hopes.To the men who feel attacked by this film, please feel attacked. This is an attack on men and rightfully so. Barbie doesn't stretch the truth or make a mockery, she puts life on the screen exactly how it is. Barbie is a mirror.And once again to the men who feel like ""this isn't for me"". If you are a heterosexual male attracted to women, the logical conclusion is to celebrate and enjoy femininity, to express curiosity, care and interest for women. A film that centres around women should immediately take your interest!To all the women reading this review, if you haven't seen the film yet, please indulge yourselves and do so.

I little better than just ok,"I'm not a fan of modern day musicals. I strongly disliked LaLaLand, could never get through it. Barbie on the other hand I watched all the way through even though I thought it was sugary sweet. Ick. Peer pressure, ""ya gotta see it!"" The last 15 minutes of dialogue in the movie was very good. Actually wish I would have just watched that last 15 minutes rather than the entire movie. The actors/actresses I felt did a good job on their characters. It would have been better, in my opinion, if Barbie was an actual movie without all the plastic sets, the portal from land to sea etc. With all the technology out there surely the sets could have been realistic.",i littl better ok,im fan modern day music i strongli dislik lalaland could never get barbi hand i watch way even though i thought sugari sweet ick peer pressur ya got ta see the last minut dialogu movi good actual wish i would watch last minut rather entir movi the actorsactress i felt good job charact it would better opinion barbi actual movi without plastic set portal land sea etc with technolog sure set could realist
Boring with heavy political messaging,"Wow, this was really bad. Here is the truth. It's boring. Plus, who wants to here about the patriarchy for 2hrs.

Let me tell you, the only fun was in the first 30 mins. Nobody, and I mean Nobody was laughing. The plot is all over the place and kind of surprising from the actual writer, which has done some great work in the past. Just makes me wonder if she was forced to push all this political stuff by corporate or she actually believes this nonsense. I thought Barbie would just be a fun goofy movie. But to be preached for 2 hours????? What the hell.

Especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, I know people were hesitant to accept him as Ken but he really knocks it out of the park, and I honestly cannot believe they considered people other than Margot Robbie to be Barbie. It's like she was BORN for this role.

A Remarkably Entertaining Piece,"This movie was a pleseant surprise. It managed to strike an excellent balance between adult and child themes, and essentially all of the humor lands well.Towards the end it gets a little preachy with a certain character's speech, which takes away from the movie a bit. The speech itself just felt odd and was a bit on the nose compared to the rest of the movie, but they managed to tie it all up at the end of the movie fairly nicely so I am willing to overlook that. I really enjoyed the overall approach they took to the Barbie Movie and it had many little humorous surprises.I'd highly reccomend the movie.

Toy-story with political sarcasm!,"I enjoyed the movie a lot with many jokes and sarcasm the characters keep throwing.It was interesting and unexpected view to face that barbie is a matriarchal concept. On the other hand, miserable but thriving Kens' lives with various music was very comical and fun. Such a landscape and world-setting is something only few of us have seen in real world where women have increasingly thrived for social power.Meanwhile, the storyline is pretty straightforward. It is a typical fantasy movie that a character goes to real world, cause a problem intertwined with the imaginary and real world and solve them together with real humans. So in that sense, there was no sequence of surprise as such. However, it was a movie with a good length of about 90 minutes, to casually enjoy watching with your family and friends!",toystori polit sarcasm,i enjoy movi lot mani joke sarcasm charact keep throwingit interest unexpect view face barbi matriarch concept on hand miser thrive ken live variou music comic fun such landscap worldset someth u seen real world woman increasingli thrive social powermeanwhil storylin pretti straightforward it typic fantasi movi charact goe real world caus problem intertwin imaginari real world solv togeth real human so sen sequenc surpris howev movi good length minut casual enjoy watch famili friend
A candy pop satire that hopefully changes the world a bit.,"I found it to be a surprising grand piece of comedic, satire story telling, again concerning questions of gender roles and toxic masculinity. By the end I was moved to tears for Barbie AND Ken. It represented to me many issues of modern times and things I was confronted with in real life. The candy pop world and performances added so much to it to support the story and as a set designer I found the Barbieworld of course mesmerizing, melancholic and so well done. I hope, apart from all the social media hype, it will do some good in the world, heals girls, women, boys and men... and all those men who got dragged by their girlfriends and found it a reminder we dont need the other gender to support our worth.

It is good but I would not say great,The film was good and there were scenes that were fun to watch. One thing it failed was being funny and there were a couple of overrated scenes. It was entertaining and many people who have seen it or are about see it would agree with me. I would not see it again anytime more this year but maybe in two years I would watch it again. There is definitely way too much hype and at least in my opinion it is not as good as everyone is saying it is. This is most money and the most successful movie a Warner bros movie has been. The certain people that would love this movie is girls. Also women and men age 30 - 50. If you a women or girl or a men I would definitely recommend this film.,it good i would say great,the film good scene fun watch one thing fail funni coupl overr scene it entertain mani peopl seen see would agre i would see anytim year mayb two year i would watch there definit way much hype least opinion good everyon say thi money success movi warner bro movi the certain peopl would love movi girl also woman men age if woman girl men i would definit recommend film
Mostly staid commentary,"I went in with high hopes for this one. The marketing of Barbie, of course, was top notch, and for a straight year audiences were given glimpses into this garish 90's realm, blue skies and beaches, neon roller blades and Ryan Gosling's bleached hair. Then my girlfriend and I both saw it, and we both yawned.For one, Barbie herself is unfortunately a bore when she should have been the shining light. Margot Robbie is one of the best actors working right now, but she couldn't even elevate this Nietzsche-ish interpretation of the character beyond the staid, reductive messaging the movie is trying to impart. She comes across as a mouthpiece, rather than a well drawn, or even fun character.She spends the whole movie disturbed by something outside of herself, 'questioning her place in the world', when the real highlight - Gosling as Ken - gets to roam around freely and steal all of the scenes. This seems brutally unfair, and kind of the opposite of the intended effect.This kind of topical storyline that strives for relevance rather than the irreverence I was hoping for makes for an extremely boring watch. Sorry, but we got tired of Barbie and her iterations fast. We both want the Ken movie now.",mostli staid commentari,i went high hope one the market barbi cours top notch straight year audienc given glimps garish realm blue sky beach neon roller blade ryan gosl bleach hair then girlfriend i saw yawnedfor one barbi unfortun bore shine light margot robbi one best actor work right couldnt even elev nietzscheish interpret charact beyond staid reduct messag movi tri impart she come across mouthpiec rather well drawn even fun charactersh spend whole movi disturb someth outsid question place world real highlight gosl ken get roam around freeli steal scene thi seem brutal unfair kind opposit intend effectthi kind topic storylin strive relev rather irrever i hope make extrem bore watch sorri got tire barbi iter fast we want ken movi

Somehow... It worked!,"Not just the intro, but the whole movie is funny and smart as hell. You are griped by the voice of Helen Mirren, interactive singing by Liso and a strong focus on humor. The details in Barbieland are hilarious. There is no water in the shower or glasses, the pool is a decoration, every night is a girl's night. It shows you how great imagination is, especially kids imagination. And it guides you to perceive the movie with an open mind. After Barbie and Ken enter the real world, it can be even more unhinged and crazy than Barbieland. What helps you to just go with it, is that this 'real world' is also shown as fiction, in details. The all the way up button in the elevator, the immediate response of the director of Mattel, that they had to get Barbie in the box, meeting the ghost of an old lady. It really helps you to let that absurd concept entertain you on every level. So you laugh a lot, cry a bit, feel motivated and you hope that everyone is truly listening to the message to love yourself.",somehow it work,not intro whole movi funni smart hell you gripe voic helen mirren interact sing liso strong focu humor the detail barbieland hilari there water shower glass pool decor everi night girl night it show great imagin especi kid imagin and guid perceiv movi open mind after barbi ken enter real world even unhing crazi barbieland what help go real world also shown fiction detail the way button elev immedi respons director mattel get barbi box meet ghost old ladi it realli help let absurd concept entertain everi level so laugh lot cri bit feel motiv hope everyon truli listen messag love

so fun!,"I'm sorry if there are some mistakes in this, english isn't my first language. This is seriously one of the funniest movies i've ever watched. I laughed everytime Ryan Gosling was on screen, he was my favorite in this movie. The only thing i would say wasn't the absolute best was the storyline.

It was great but...,"I like the overall feeling of the movie. It was created so beautifully and with such care and creativity and love for the Barbie universe
It was also so silly and fun.But it was alot and honstly a bit too long.It was saying alot of what felt like important things but somehow it felt flat.Maybe i just like a movie that just is a movie.Though it is so understandalbe that in that Barbie universe they like to explore and acknowledge those huge subjects such as gender equality. In that veiw the small problem i have is they may have tried to hard and the story got lost a bit.In the light of all that Someway somehow it becomes though fun a bit of an forgettable experience.Ps.

Changed me,"Barbie changed me for the better. It made me appreciate being a woman all over again, it made me appreciate my mother more and it made me more grateful to have 3 little girls. It'll make Barbie playtime more special and fun. It'll be a staple in my home and something that grows with me and my girls. It was funny, emotional, energetic and wholesome. Every time Barbie cried, I cried. Every time she laughed , I laughed. Growing up Barbie was my go to toy , it brought me comfort and fun.

Someone's a fan of Warren Beatty,"Basically a Mattel remake of Heaven Can Wait: A person travels to a separate 'reality' to better understand who they are and what they have to offer in this world, and how the two worlds are connected. Add to it the fun movie opening rip off of 2001 Space Odyssey, it's hard to say that this is a very original movie. However, Margot Robbie brings it home and grounds the emotional side of the movie beautifully. The colour palette and the messages are worthwhile, ballsy directing and old for this role but excellent Gosling make it worth seeing. Will we remember this movie few years from now? No. But doesn't mean it's not worth seeing.",someon fan warren beatti,basic mattel remak heaven can wait a person travel separ realiti better understand offer world two world connect add fun movi open rip space odyssey hard say origin movi howev margot robbi bring home ground emot side movi beauti the colour palett messag worthwhil ballsi direct old role excel gosl make worth see will rememb movi year no but doesnt mean worth see
"Sure, Life in Plastic is Fantastic but ONLY in Barbieland","The Barbie movie was unexpected. It was a colorful and clever ride in the cinema. I was not expecting all the deep emotions that the film gave. Life is not all about perfection, which a lot of people wants to constantly achieve these days, imperfections is what identifies us and that's okay.I'm a visual kind of cinema goer and I have the say that dance sequence (Dance the Night) and the scene where Barbie and Ken where traveling to the real world were AMAZING. Kudos to the creative team behind it, I absolutely adore the set.Greta Gerwig and her team delivered a visual spectacle with a heart.",sure life plastic fantast onli barbieland,the barbi movi unexpect it color clever ride cinema i expect deep emot film gave life perfect lot peopl want constantli achiev day imperfect identifi u that okayim visual kind cinema goer i say danc sequenc danc night scene barbi ken travel real world amaz kudo creativ team behind i absolut ador setgreta gerwig team deliv visual spectacl heart
"A great deal of fun, and kinda profound too","This movie was just so fun to watch. I'm not personally a fan of barbie, never really played with them or interacted with the IP in anyway, but just the pure outlandish absurdity of this movie and the over-the-top acting... I couldn't stop laughing throughout most of the runtime.Based on how the movie was marketed, I was 100% expecting to be pondering the question, ""what does it mean to exist?"" by the end. Well, the movie pondered the question, came to a conclusion, and then told me what that conclusion was in a way that was very clear and easy to understand. Personally, I like when a movie isn't exactly clear. I like when I have to dig a little, think about it, discuss it with other people. With Barbie, I felt no need for that. The message was crystal clear. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing, but it was just a little too on the nose for my taste.All in all, a super fun watch. I saw this with my family. We bought popcorn, milkshakes, and it was a great time.",a great deal fun kinda profound,thi movi fun watch im person fan barbi never realli play interact ip anyway pure outlandish absurd movi overthetop act i couldnt stop laugh throughout runtimebas movi market i expect ponder question mean exist end well movi ponder question came conclus told conclus way clear easi understand person i like movi isnt exactli clear i like i dig littl think discus peopl with barbi i felt need the messag crystal clear i dont think necessarili bad thing littl nose tasteal super fun watch i saw famili we bought popcorn milkshak great time
Barbie,"This film is a mess. I understand the film has become politicized by now but just from a filmmaking perspective the film is all over the place.I like Greta Gerwig & most of what she's made. But the story of Barbie somehow becoming real and learning to be a human being doesn't make sense in the context of the film. She just somehow ends up on earth and real. No explanation. I'm not sure if the film is about finding yourself as a woman in the world or about being a mother or about not being controlled. Its messaging is chaotic.The set design is pretty cool i suppose but I couldn't help but think it's a Wes Anderson rip off.The acting is ok, I really don't understand the hype of this movie. Ryan Gosling clearly steals the show here and every time he isn't on screen the film is boring. Margot Robbie is fantastic as an actress but she's playing Barbie... the character is interesting in anyway. I get it she learns to be herself but it's so preachy towards the end it's almost gross in how serious the film takes itself near the end.A lot of hype for this film especially when we still all know Barbie's are not good for little girls yet Mattel tricked little girls into thinking Barbie's are cool and good for them again. That company gets richer while the same problems still exist that the film is trying to bring to the spotlight. The film is mostly a nightmare & complete contradiction that's entertaining a bit because of Gosling. Really overrated film. This is an Oscar's frontrunner?

I loved it,"Barbie was an incredible movie and experience. There was a perfect balance between the replication of our own childhood experiences with the dolls, and the introduction of the hopeful changes for the current state of the world. The way the movie made our little imaginations come to life on the big screen was magical. It was great to see a movie about barbie, the stereotypical perfect doll , being so inclusive and aware of issues we still have today. It was emotional, funny, and a breath of fresh air. Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and the rest of the cast... just bravo. It was truly so wonderful & I can't wait to watch it again.",i love,barbi incred movi experi there perfect balanc replic childhood experi doll introduct hope chang current state world the way movi made littl imagin come life big screen magic it great see movi barbi stereotyp perfect doll inclus awar issu still today it emot funni breath fresh air margot robbi ryan gosl rest cast bravo it truli wonder i cant wait watch
A Playful Adventure with a Dash of Reflection,"Under the direction of Greta Gerwig, Barbie (2023), featuring Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and America Ferrera, delivers a charming escapade into the whimsical world of Barbieland. The film showcases commendable performances, humorous moments, yet falls short due to an average storyline that could have benefited from less emphasis on challenging societal norms.Captivating Performances:
Margot Robbie's portrayal of Barbie is both charismatic and vulnerable, embodying the iconic doll with flair. Ryan Gosling as Ken brings unexpected depth to his character, and America Ferrera's Gloria serves as an emotional anchor, enriching the ensemble with her performance.Humor and Light-Hearted Moments:
Barbie doesn't shy away from humor, with witty moments sprinkled throughout the narrative, especially in the antics of Ken. The film successfully balances its playful nature with light-hearted scenes that keep the audience engaged.Average Storyline with Missed Opportunities:
The film's central plot, while entertaining, lacks the cohesion needed to make it truly memorable. The emphasis on challenging stereotypes and societal norms, although commendable, occasionally detracts from the potential richness of the narrative. If the focus had shifted more towards the development of the storyline, it could have elevated the overall cinematic experience.Imaginative World-Building:
Barbieland is a visual delight, thanks to Gerwig's imaginative world-building. The vibrant and colorful depiction of the doll universe creates a captivating backdrop for the characters' adventures.Final Verdict - 6/10:
Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig and brought to life by a talented cast, receives a respectable 6 out of 10. While the film delights with its performances, humorous moments, and imaginative setting, it falls short of achieving greatness due to an average storyline. A slight shift in focus from challenging societal norms to a more intricate exploration of the storyline could have provided a more satisfying cinematic experience. Nonetheless, Barbie remains an enjoyable and whimsical journey into a world where plastic meets profound reflection.",a play adventur dash reflect,under direct greta gerwig barbi featur margot robbi ryan gosl america ferrera deliv charm escapad whimsic world barbieland the film showcas commend perform humor moment yet fall short due averag storylin could benefit le emphasi challeng societ normscaptiv perform margot robbi portray barbi charismat vulner embodi icon doll flair ryan gosl ken bring unexpect depth charact america ferrera gloria serv emot anchor enrich ensembl performancehumor lightheart moment barbi doesnt shi away humor witti moment sprinkl throughout narr especi antic ken the film success balanc play natur lightheart scene keep audienc engagedaverag storylin miss opportun the film central plot entertain lack cohes need make truli memor the emphasi challeng stereotyp societ norm although commend occasion detract potenti rich narr if focu shift toward develop storylin could elev overal cinemat experienceimagin worldbuild barbieland visual delight thank gerwig imagin worldbuild the vibrant color depict doll univers creat captiv backdrop charact adventuresfin verdict barbi direct greta gerwig brought life talent cast receiv respect while film delight perform humor moment imagin set fall short achiev great due averag storylin a slight shift focu challeng societ norm intric explor storylin could provid satisfi cinemat experi nonetheless barbi remain enjoy whimsic journey world plastic meet profound reflect
"So, so bad","It got a 3 because there were a few laughs.But if we are being true to Barbie, she is 19, Ken is 17, so these two leads are too old to play these characters. But that aside. This was a terribley bad movie. The story line was so silly, the characters were so stupid, in the literal sense. I was really looking forward to watching this with my daughter, well the whole family really, but my daughter especially, and she hated the movie. The whole family did. We were all bored, all didn't like the story, all thought it was stupid.

"A movie for everyone (yes, even men)","I anticipated this movie long before it came out and already watched it twice in the cinema. Greta Gerwig managed to make our wildest Barbie-dreams come true and not only created some of the funniest comedy i've seen in a long time in a movie, but also made me agree so hard with every feminist message she put in the film. Messages that everyone needs to hear - even, or should i say, especially men.The performances where wonderful, particularly that of Ryan Gosling who really tapped into his Kenergy. I thought it was interesting to see that not only Barbie aka Margo Robbie got a character arc, where she got to grow up to become a woman. Also Ken aka Ryan Gosling underwent some significant character growth that I much appreciated.As the trailer said; If you love Barbie, you will love this film. If you hate Barbie, you will still love this film. Because it isn't only about a doll, but also about the patriarchal system we all have to deal with on a daily basis and about the complexity that is human life in general.

There is fun to be had,"Barbie is not just a stereotypical Hollywood film to celebrate the well-known brand. But it dives in deeper into more self existence, gender equality and journey of life. The messages however are understandably more female centric but still can be enjoyed and appreciated by all, barring the Mattel Company staff scenes and characters that doest not land. They are portrayed unconvincingly with nonchalant writing and takes you out of the film . The third act feels over-bloated that dips the high trajectory gear that the film was on since the start.

Confusing message for dolls or humans?,"I enjoyed the film more for its choreography and the characters' sympathy than for the confusing message. Is it that Ken should understand he was created to be Barbie's friend forever? Is it that a man in love must surrender to a second place? I hope I can read the actual purpose of the story from the writers.Barbieland is shown as a happy monotonous human-like world with empty containers resembling our not so happy monotonous real life where men condescend with a higher ranked male model, something a second rank character wished to be back at his fantasy world.

Exceeded expectations,"I had high hopes for this film and have been looking forward to it for about a year. I was blown away by the level of humor, the emotion, the meaning, everything! Honestly, it should've been called Ken, as Ryan Gosling stole the show. I've always thought that he was underrated as a comedic actor. He was Ken. He owned it. He deserves awards for completely giving himself over to the character. Having said that, the entire cast was awesome. The music was incredible. The set design was perfect. I laughed and cried throughout. I didn't expect all of the feels, but there were so many messages that touched my heart.

Bitter sweet movie,"Firstly I'll say that I'm the movie's target audience: a female in her 20s. Even though the movie touched some subjects like the fact that a lot of girls grew up with Barbies and felt very insecure about their bodies (which I 100% agree with), and the right to choose what you want to be in your life, it felt uncomfortable; it felt as if all men in the movie were emasculated. In the world of barbie all Kens were uncomfortably stupid and only served for comedic purposes. I won't give spoilers but in this ""perfect"" barbie world you would expect that they would achieve true gender equality since not only Barbie but the Ken dolls are also doctors, scientists, politicians etc etc.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling went above and beyond; I enjoyed their performances. Some scenes were also very funny but personally I did not like the ending.",bitter sweet movi,firstli ill say im movi target audienc femal even though movi touch subject like fact lot girl grew barbi felt insecur bodi i agre right choos want life felt uncomfort felt men movi emascul in world barbi ken uncomfort stupid serv comed purpos i wont give spoiler perfect barbi world would expect would achiev true gender equal sinc barbi ken doll also doctor scientist politician etc etcmargot robbi ryan gosl went beyond i enjoy perform some scene also funni person i like end
if you're mad you missed the point,"This movie was so absurd and so fun! I laughed so hard my face hurt. I see people feeling like this movie concluded that women are better than men, but the lesson was to celebrate womanhood in all its forms, with the overarching message for everyone being to find who you are on your own. Barbie told ken he should stand in his own light and find out who he is outside of his relationship with her! He's kEnough!!! I think because this was such a big budget and highly publicized movie, people don't super know who greta gerwig is and how her past movies have really celebrated womanhood through all its phases, especially the messy parts. It was so fantastic and so nuanced and self aware, i'm grateful this movie exists! P.s. If ur mad that the barbies didn't give the kens true parity and just threw some lower level judge position at them, then wait until you find about what the supreme court in the real world does!!!!",your mad miss point,thi movi absurd fun i laugh hard face hurt i see peopl feel like movi conclud woman better men lesson celebr womanhood form overarch messag everyon find barbi told ken stand light find outsid relationship he kenough i think big budget highli public movi peopl dont super know greta gerwig past movi realli celebr womanhood phase especi messi part it fantast nuanc self awar im grate movi exist p if ur mad barbi didnt give ken true pariti threw lower level judg posit wait find suprem court real world
Better movie then expected,"I expected nothing good out of this movie but it ended up being better than expected. It honestly didn't feel like they got woke it more seems like they made fun of both sides of the coin. Ryan Gosling was ironic and made a relatable Ken. I love the humor of the narrator when she roasted Margot Robbie. Overall it was a surprisingly well developed plot with cringe but comedic humor that actually is memorable.This movie isn't for everyone but it does have elements in it that can attract more people to watch it then most people think. And gotta love the memes that instantly came out about ""when you watch the Oppenheimer and then go to watch Barbie right after"". This movie was a culture shock in a good way, according to the trendy memes right after the release.",better movi expect,i expect noth good movi end better expect it honestli didnt feel like got woke seem like made fun side coin ryan gosl iron made relat ken i love humor narrat roast margot robbi overal surprisingli well develop plot cring comed humor actual memorablethi movi isnt everyon element attract peopl watch peopl think and got ta love meme instantli came watch oppenheim go watch barbi right thi movi cultur shock good way accord trendi meme right releas
Loved Ryan Gosling but not the movie,"I don't get the hype.But I'll start with Ryan Gosling was very funny. Margot Robbie was very good, too.But...The dialogue is on-the-nose simplistic. No subtext, no nuance.Most of the music sucked, but I did like Billie Eilish's song at the end.Is it supposed to be a comedy? Only one line made me laugh: ""I want to play the guitar at you."" And Ken's double sunglasses were funny.The ""real world"" wasn't any less cartoony than Barbieland. The Mattel execs were too silly, not funny, and Keystone Cop-py.All the movies propositions, or whatever, have now been around at least 70 years. Likely more (suffragettes). And they're hammered at you, rather than shown.I did like learning about the inventor of the Barbie doll, but that was one brief scene.That said, I can see Gerwig has directing talent and inventiveness. But for me, this movie was not good. Sometimes I like movies better on a second watching, so I watched it twice. Still didn't like it.I agree with the filmmakers' philosophy, but it didn't work for me as a movie.",love ryan gosl movi,i dont get hypebut ill start ryan gosl funni margot robbi good toobutth dialogu onthenos simplist no subtext nuancemost music suck i like billi eilish song endi suppos comedi onli one line made laugh i want play guitar and ken doubl sunglass funnyth real world wasnt le cartooni barbieland the mattel exec silli funni keyston coppyal movi proposit whatev around least year like suffragett and theyr hammer rather showni like learn inventor barbi doll one brief scenethat said i see gerwig direct talent invent but movi good sometim i like movi better second watch i watch twice still didnt like iti agre filmmak philosophi didnt work movi

Think I forgot how to be happy. Something I'm not but something I can be.,"BarbieLet me start by saying that this was much better than I thought it was going to be. As a man, my perspective was more on how the Ken dolls were portrayed and boy was I in for a ride on the toxic masculinity surfboard. Gender stereotypes are played up as both Barbie and Ken go out into the real world to find the meaning of Barbie's sudden ennui about mortality. And Ken went because he wants to impress Barbie. As one does.What's interesting about this movie is that all of the female characters in ""Barbie Land"" are in the successful careers that Mattel designed which seems ideal. But once in the real world, Barbie discovers it painted an unrealistic goal of easy achievement. Don't tell the Barbie dolls that! They all enjoyed pointing out their positions in life, while the Ken dolls begged for attention with their ripped abs and terrible surfing skills. It was absolutely hilarious that the Ken dolls were unable to function without finding a way to please their unrequited love. Turning the stereotypes of women needing a man on its head was giggle worthy in the way it was portrayed, especially with the homoeroticism.Barbie Land, to the dolls, is considered perfect. Think about that for a moment. It is played for laughs but it is being clever at hiding the dark secret that ""Stereotypical Barbie"" uncovers. This is a world where women are celebrated for succeeding, but still locked into a literal box, defined by a single dimension. It's cute that the women don't need men, but utopia is impossible to achieve with this strict design.But off to the real world they went, and Ken discovered the truth of a male dominated world, and chaos ensues. I laughed throughout most of the movie, and then Billie Eilish's song, What Was I Made For?, played and my heart stopped. Listen to it, trust me.Everyone matters. Everyone is multifaceted and cannot possibly be defined by any one, two or even a thousand things. Female empowerment at the expense of male emasculation is just as bad as the patriarchy already taking place. I like the message, which needs to be repeated, everyone matters. You are the person that is celebrated because you are who you are. Love yourself and forge your path. There are no definitions.I love this movie. I can't say enough about it, but I will close with another accolade for Billie Eilish. Girl, I cry every time I hear your song.",think i forgot happi someth im someth i,barbielet start say much better i thought go a man perspect ken doll portray boy i ride toxic masculin surfboard gender stereotyp play barbi ken go real world find mean barbi sudden ennui mortal and ken went want impress barbi a one doeswhat interest movi femal charact barbi land success career mattel design seem ideal but real world barbi discov paint unrealist goal easi achiev dont tell barbi doll they enjoy point posit life ken doll beg attent rip ab terribl surf skill it absolut hilari ken doll unabl function without find way plea unrequit love turn stereotyp woman need man head giggl worthi way portray especi homoeroticismbarbi land doll consid perfect think moment it play laugh clever hide dark secret stereotyp barbi uncov thi world woman celebr succeed still lock liter box defin singl dimens it cute woman dont need men utopia imposs achiev strict designbut real world went ken discov truth male domin world chao ensu i laugh throughout movi billi eilish song what wa i made for play heart stop listen trust meeveryon matter everyon multifacet possibl defin one two even thousand thing femal empower expens male emascul bad patriarchi alreadi take place i like messag need repeat everyon matter you person celebr love forg path there definitionsi love movi i cant say enough i close anoth accolad billi eilish girl i cri everi time i hear song
Funny. Heartwarming.,"In spite of the crying child in the movie theater, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I did not know what to expect going in. I was pleasantly surprised and found myself giggling at each unexpected turn of the story. It was hilarious watching Ken become infatuated with the patriarchy and then quickly shifting to find Barbie coming to terms with the pains of reality kept me on my toes. And these two competing outlooks found a beautiful synthesis at the end. Funny. Heartwarming. I learned more about Barbie than I ever thought I would.

unexpectedly profound,"Thought i was in for a witty, sugar coat covered comedy in which i would have sang the praises of Robbie, Gosling and the production design team. And while that for sure happened, i also found an unexpectedly deep movie, one that even if maybe at times is a bit redundant with its expression of theme, always find an original way to convey it, and really goes some unexpected places emotionally. Truly special, at times laugh-out-loud funny, and in a couple of instances surprisingly moving. The direction is focused, Gosling's comedic timing is impeccable, Robbie's bravura shines throughout, the soundtrack is one smash hit after the other, and yes, omg, the sets are truly amazing.",unexpectedli profound,thought witti sugar coat cover comedi would sang prais robbi gosl product design team and sure happen also found unexpectedli deep movi one even mayb time bit redund express theme alway find origin way convey realli goe unexpect place emot truli special time laughoutloud funni coupl instanc surprisingli move the direct focus gosl comed time impecc robbi bravura shine throughout soundtrack one smash hit ye omg set truli amaz
Beautiful But Too Obvious,"Barbie is undoubtedly an exceptionally unique film, expressing an appreciation for art and beauty, with visible brilliance behind a carefully crafted script aimed at sending a message, enriched by elements of comedy and irony.The plot revolves around the protagonist Barbie, who was expelled from Barbieland for not conforming to the beauty and perfection standards imposed by the perfect world. Upon entering our world, she discovers that reality is very different from what she imagined, facing sexism and gender inequality. This leads her to reconsider how society should handle differences, especially gender-related ones.The film manages to balance animation and emotion, maintaining a focus on the comedy while also delving into deep drama, particularly when the protagonist confronts adversities in a society dominated by patriarchy.The setting of the work is highly immersive, enhanced by the intelligent direction of Greta Gerwig and the captivating performances of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. This results in a film that captivates the viewer's attention and effectively conveys the necessary emotions.However, due to the dialogues, the film becomes quite obvious, leaving little room for artistic interpretations or for the audience to absorb the message in a more personal way. This makes the work, as it approaches the end, somewhat predictable and, to some extent, unnecessary, considering that the message was delivered from the beginning.",beauti but too obviou,barbi undoubtedli except uniqu film express appreci art beauti visibl brillianc behind care craft script aim send messag enrich element comedi ironyth plot revolv around protagonist barbi expel barbieland conform beauti perfect standard impos perfect world upon enter world discov realiti differ imagin face sexism gender inequ thi lead reconsid societi handl differ especi genderrel onesth film manag balanc anim emot maintain focu comedi also delv deep drama particularli protagonist confront advers societi domin patriarchyth set work highli immers enhanc intellig direct greta gerwig captiv perform margot robbi ryan gosl thi result film captiv viewer attent effect convey necessari emotionshowev due dialogu film becom quit obviou leav littl room artist interpret audienc absorb messag person way thi make work approach end somewhat predict extent unnecessari consid messag deliv begin
Not a fan of this movie. Too cringe to me,"Now I know a lot of people especially women like Barbie a lot, but this movie was just too cringe to me. The story was weird, the acting was a bit off, not very many characters were likable and it was also very weird seeing Ryan Gosling sing a song in this movie and he's not even that very good of a singer. I don't think this movie should even be nominated for an Oscar for best picture. It's probably likely that it will be nominated for a Razzie for most cringe movie ever. The ending wasn't that great either. Sure we got to meet Barbies creator, but it still wasn't very good. 3 out of 10 for this.",not fan movi too cring,now i know lot peopl especi woman like barbi lot movi cring the stori weird act bit mani charact likabl also weird see ryan gosl sing song movi he even good singer i dont think movi even nomin oscar best pictur it probabl like nomin razzi cring movi ever the end wasnt great either sure got meet barbi creator still wasnt good

Margot Robbie is the perfect ""stereotypical Barbie"" and Ryan Gosling is absolutely hilarious as Ken. But really the entire cast is terrific.

"AS A POWERLIFTING, MASCULINE MALE...","I loved the laughs that I got out of this movie! Being able to make fun of yourself makes life so much better! The movie was very meta and definitely knew what it was doing. The feel did give slight first season of the office vibes every now and then, but it hit the message home! The main actors In Barbie and Ken were exactly what the movie needed. Will Ferrell showing up was kinda weird not gonna lie, but he did fit into his ""bumbling idiot in charge of everything"" role perfectly. I would also love to see other men step up and say they enjoyed this movie. It was like sitting through a good roast. We should also listen to the true message, and make way for a more equal world.

Could have been feministic in a good way,"With all the hype around this film, my expectations were high and were initially met. The film begins as a self-aware, lighthearted critique of its own legacy but, as Barbie steps her flattened foot into the real world, transcends into a clumsy story on gender inequalities. Whilst funny and original at first, it doesn't take long to notice the repetition of the same jokes that were introduced in the initial minutes of the script, as the film transitions into a full-blown battle of the sexes. Despite these flaws, the casting is well-executed, with Ryan Gosling delivering a brilliant performance as Ken. Unfortunately, even his portrayal is unable to compensate for the deficient plot.",could feminist good way,with hype around film expect high initi met the film begin selfawar lightheart critiqu legaci barbi step flatten foot real world transcend clumsi stori gender inequ whilst funni origin first doesnt take long notic repetit joke introduc initi minut script film transit fullblown battl sex despit flaw cast wellexecut ryan gosl deliv brilliant perform ken unfortun even portray unabl compens defici plot

Funny with some great acting. Too preachy.,"A movie that delivered a great few laughs, with Gosling taking the show. Margot was fantastic, really showcasing her talent as an actor. However, for the main character of the show it did not seem that way - Ken took most of the limelight. Rightfully so with Ryan playing a stellar part.The story starts off light hearted and fun but takes a dive with preaching against the patriarchy. While granted in this day and age, there's a limit to the level of guff one can take.A colourful and fun movie that always tries to be more than it can be.

literally perfect,"It exceeded my expectations. Truly an amazing film. Everything was gorgeous, the actors were perfect for their roles, the music was awesome (i'm just ken is top tier), the plot was super interesting, the outfits were amazing and truly connected with barbies through history, which leads me to say that is also a historical movie that shows the different barbies that existed or/and got cancelled through the decades.It think it's a movie that has a significant impact after watching, is highkey emotional and touch themes that probably a 7 year old will not understand. I recommend this movie mainly for adults because it is related to subjects that we experience everyday mixed with nostalgy (I cried twice during the film) and great sense of humor.

"Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" left me in tears, yet I find myself giving it a 6 out of 10 rating.","The film's marketing portrayed it as a story about a doll entering the real world, but it surprisingly delves deeper into themes of feminism and patriarchy that were not adequately highlighted in the trailers. Had I not accidentally stumbled upon some spoilers before seeing the film, I would have been taken aback, expecting a more lighthearted and joyful adventure.Instead, ""Barbie"" turned out to be a story that explores the value of women and their place in society. While the central idea is commendable, the execution fell somewhat short for me. The plot became predictable once the main theme was revealed, and I could foresee the unfolding events and the movie's conclusion.Undoubtedly, the movie's core message is strong, but I couldn't fully embrace its realization. I agree with the critics' observations regarding the one-dimensional portrayal of male characters and the lack of true equality in the ending, despite the intentions.Still, ""Barbie"" has several strengths. The visual style is captivating, and the beauty of Barbieland is truly enchanting. In addition, the actors deliver commendable performances that add depth to their characters.On the downside, some of the characters who are not dolls themselves seem a bit too childish in their behavior, which detracts from the overall balance. Also, the treatment of the Kens raised some concerns and left room for improvement.In conclusion, ""Barbie"" tackles an important and relevant issue, but it could have been executed more effectively. Despite its shortcomings, the movie manages to leave an emotional impact thanks to its captivating visuals and strong performances.",greta gerwig barbi left tear yet i find give rate,the film market portray stori doll enter real world surprisingli delv deeper theme femin patriarchi adequ highlight trailer had i accident stumbl upon spoiler see film i would taken aback expect lightheart joy adventureinstead barbi turn stori explor valu woman place societi while central idea commend execut fell somewhat short the plot becam predict main theme reveal i could forese unfold event movi conclusionundoubtedli movi core messag strong i couldnt fulli embrac realiz i agre critic observ regard onedimension portray male charact lack true equal end despit intentionsstil barbi sever strength the visual style captiv beauti barbieland truli enchant in addit actor deliv commend perform add depth characterson downsid charact doll seem bit childish behavior detract overal balanc also treatment ken rais concern left room improvementin conclus barbi tackl import relev issu could execut effect despit shortcom movi manag leav emot impact thank captiv visual strong perform
Wow just wow,"I saw this movie opening night and my expectations were beyond met and exceeded the limitations of what I thought a good movie was. It was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I was moved completely and entirely. I laughed, I cried, and I left the movie changed. It is a masterpiece. For those who don't understand, I highly recommend watching the movie again. The writing, the characters, the set, and the outfits were so brilliantly curated. I do not even hesitate to say it is now one of my favorite movies and one of the best movies I have EVER seen. Greta Gerwig is nothing less than a genius and deserves ALL of the recognition. The casting was perfection. The meaning behind the movie holds a special place in my heart and EVERY SINGLE PERSON NEEDS to see this movie. My favorite part of the movie was not ONLY the movie itself but the effect it is having on the communities surrounding it. The collective unspoken rule of dressing up to go see this movie.

Cerebral and Extremely Fun; Not Without Its Flaws,"I saw this movie the other night and had a phenomenal experience. However, I've needed to sit on it for a little while because there were certain elements that I wasn't sure how to feel about. First, Ken. The character himself was hilarious and Ryan Gosling did an outstanding job doing him justice. I loved how his plot discussed radicalization into patriarchal thinking, (like, the guy just wanted to learn about horses! But pipelines into misogyny are literally everywhere, so Ken, being naive, just falls into it), as well as the societal expectation of *needing* to be in a romantic relationship to a codependent extent, leading into incel ideology.The thing that rubbed me the wrong way was how in the end, after he became his normal self, it felt as if the movie just expected me to be laughing along with him again... like, I still don't wanna be rooting for this guy. Seeing people's response to him as a character after the movie had me confused. I understand, Ryan Gosling is so fine, but Ken is not your babygirl! He still tried to install a patriarchal state and never really apologized!!The plot with the real-world Mattel executives also just felt a little unnecessary to me. It was funny, don't get me wrong, but it just kind of happened and I wasn't sure what to glean from it. At one point I found myself thinking, like, what happened to those guys?? And then they just kinda showed up at the end. I also know it was meant to be commentary on Mattel's predominantly male leadership, but... like, YOU are Mattel. You have a male CEO. Like thanks for addressing it, but you have no room to talk.I think some of the time with this unnecessary plot point could've been used to touch a bit more on body image issues, because that is a HUGE criticism of the Barbie brand. Like, okay. You had one token fat Barbie with an otherwise entirely straight-sized cast. But some of the jokes were just like ""pregnant people are weird 😂"" and they never entirely said ""hey cellulite is not scary its just how it happens""
I think they *tried* to do something about aging being beautiful but it was not really explicit enough to come across. I think it could've been pretty easy to incorporate a scene, like when Barbie tried tea for the first time, to be like wow! Indulging in pleasures with your food is good and not an indicator of your moral value!Despite my criticisms, I would say this movie is a must-watch. The points it makes are really important. And I actually found the comedy funny instead of cringe, which is rare for me with these types of films!More of a 7.5/10 than a 7, if I had to say.",cerebr extrem fun not without it flaw,i saw movi night phenomen experi howev ive need sit littl certain element i wasnt sure feel first ken the charact hilari ryan gosl outstand job justic i love plot discus radic patriarch think like guy want learn hors but pipelin misogyni liter everywher ken naiv fall well societ expect need romant relationship codepend extent lead incel ideologyth thing rub wrong way end becam normal self felt movi expect laugh along like i still dont wan na root guy see peopl respons charact movi confus i understand ryan gosl fine ken babygirl he still tri instal patriarch state never realli apologizedth plot realworld mattel execut also felt littl unnecessari it funni dont get wrong kind happen i wasnt sure glean at one point i found think like happen guy and kinda show end i also know meant commentari mattel predominantli male leadership like you mattel you male ceo like thank address room talki think time unnecessari plot point couldv use touch bit bodi imag issu huge critic barbi brand like okay you one token fat barbi otherwis entir straightsiz cast but joke like pregnant peopl weird never entir said hey cellulit scari happen i think tri someth age beauti realli explicit enough come across i think couldv pretti easi incorpor scene like barbi tri tea first time like wow indulg pleasur food good indic moral valuedespit critic i would say movi mustwatch the point make realli import and i actual found comedi funni instead cring rare type filmsmor i say

A fun watch with your partner,"Barbie can offer genuine fun when enjoyed with a partner and a carefree attitude, but I strongly advise against watching it in the cinema. The movie lacks the expected nostalgia that a Barbie film should evoke, and it is riddled with hypocrisy and statements that don't hold true within the storyline.At its best, the movie is decent. The acting overral is commendable, especially with Margot Robbie delivering a great performance and being a good fit for her role. Some scenes are enjoyable and endearing, capable of eliciting laughter and providing a good time, but they don't leave a lasting impact. The soundtrack, from my perspective, was consistently great throughout the film with just a couple odd choices.However, my main issue with the movie lies in its overt push of social and political views onto the audience. Instead of letting the viewers interpret the themes on their own, the film explicitly spells out its messages, which can be off-putting. The movie seems too focused on trying to please every audience, resulting in a predictable Hollywood cliché.Moreover, it appears that the film fails to cater to two significant demographics. Younger viewers might struggle to follow the movie and comprehend its messages, leaving them disconnected and confused. On the other hand, older audiences, who would have been the main target for nostalgic appeal, may find this aspect lacking in the film, missing an opportunity to connect on a deeper level.In summary, while Barbie can be enjoyable when approached with the right mindset and company, the movie falls short of meeting expectations. The strong performances and some fun moments are marred by heavy-handed messaging and a failure to deliver the nostalgia that fans were hoping for.",a fun watch partner,barbi offer genuin fun enjoy partner carefre attitud i strongli advis watch cinema the movi lack expect nostalgia barbi film evok riddl hypocrisi statement dont hold true within storylineat best movi decent the act overr commend especi margot robbi deliv great perform good fit role some scene enjoy endear capabl elicit laughter provid good time dont leav last impact the soundtrack perspect consist great throughout film coupl odd choiceshowev main issu movi lie overt push social polit view onto audienc instead let viewer interpret theme film explicitli spell messag offput the movi seem focus tri plea everi audienc result predict hollywood clichmoreov appear film fail cater two signific demograph younger viewer might struggl follow movi comprehend messag leav disconnect confus on hand older audienc would main target nostalg appeal may find aspect lack film miss opportun connect deeper levelin summari barbi enjoy approach right mindset compani movi fall short meet expect the strong perform fun moment mar heavyhand messag failur deliv nostalgia fan hope
Started good,"The movie started on the light side and fun, but the longer it went on the more preachy it became. It seemed the movie could not make up its mind if it was going to be a light and a fun movie or a heavy teaching a life lesson movie. This gives the viewer a roller coaster type viewing, where you are laughing a little (not a lot), but then the movie goes into a long, life lesson on how men are bad, and not very smart, but somehow they run the real world. Women are the real smart ones and the real world needs to change to match Barbie world. This changes the whole movie from just a fun time to head beating lesson, which takes a lot of the fun out of it. Too bad.",start good,the movi start light side fun longer went preachi becam it seem movi could make mind go light fun movi heavi teach life lesson movi thi give viewer roller coaster type view laugh littl lot movi goe long life lesson men bad smart somehow run real world woman real smart one real world need chang match barbi world thi chang whole movi fun time head beat lesson take lot fun too bad
Hilarious and Thoughtful,"This is actually very close to a great movie. It deserves your time and money at the theatres. Remember Lego Movie? How no one was expecting anything from it, labelling it as a cash grab? And it actually turned out to be a thoughtful, clever comedy? This movie is just as good.This is a fun, over the top, laugh out loud comedy that manages to communicate a very necessary message. I loved how much fun it had in doing that. It used comedy as a tool to prove its point. It's not easy guys. Making a satire itself is not easy, let alone turning Barbie into a good movie.The over-the-top way this movie made fun of sexism was hilariously genius. It reminded me of ""Don't Look Up"". That was another movie that deliberately made its characters unrealistically unlikeable to prove its point using humour. There are dialogues in this movie where I was like, it's funny but yeah, it needed to be said. The way this movie constantly made jabs at where gender equality stands at the moment, was genius.Everyone in this movie is having so much fun. The actors, all of them gave hilarious performances. Ryan Gosling, especially, was so funny. His character was so integral to the main theme of this movie.This movie is so self aware, that I wouldn't have been surprised if a character just mentioned the opening weekend battle with Oppenheimer.It has a few problems though. While the way the main theme of this movie is concluded was more or less perfect, I thought the way Barbie's character was concluded didn't make much sense and was sort of contradictory. And given that it's a very over the top comedy, some scenes do stretch a bit too much. It can get a bit too preachy at times too.But honestly, I had a great time. I would highly recommend watching this in theatres. In fact, my entire hall was laughing throughout the movie.",hilari thought,thi actual close great movi it deserv time money theatr rememb lego movi how one expect anyth label cash grab and actual turn thought clever comedi thi movi goodthi fun top laugh loud comedi manag commun necessari messag i love much fun it use comedi tool prove point it easi guy make satir easi let alon turn barbi good movieth overthetop way movi made fun sexism hilari geniu it remind dont look up that anoth movi deliber made charact unrealist unlik prove point use humour there dialogu movi i like funni yeah need said the way movi constantli made jab gender equal stand moment geniuseveryon movi much fun the actor gave hilari perform ryan gosl especi funni hi charact integr main theme moviethi movi self awar i wouldnt surpris charact mention open weekend battl oppenheimerit problem though while way main theme movi conclud le perfect i thought way barbi charact conclud didnt make much sen sort contradictori and given top comedi scene stretch bit much it get bit preachi time toobut honestli i great time i would highli recommend watch theatr in fact entir hall laugh throughout movi
Visually appealing but 'meh',"Visually, it was a great movie to watch - colourful, cute and quirky. I enjoyed the first 20 - 30 minutes and then it went downhill from there. There's a lot of fantastic actors in it but I didn't go in with high expectations as I had no idea what to expect.For the story itself - sure, there were some morals and statements presented but it was a bit flat and a lot of the same. I left feeling totally underwhelmed. Gosling was great though. A few bits did make me laugh but it struggled to hold my attention. As sometimes happens, a lot of the funny parts were in the film trailers. I wouldn't watch it a second time through.",visual appeal meh,visual great movi watch colour cute quirki i enjoy first minut went downhil there lot fantast actor i didnt go high expect i idea expectfor stori sure moral statement present bit flat lot i left feel total underwhelm gosl great though a bit make laugh struggl hold attent a sometim happen lot funni part film trailer i wouldnt watch second time
I love Barbie!,"Barbie is a beautiful, funny, relatable movie that I enjoyed very much. Margot Robbie, who plays Barbie, and Ryan Gosling, who plays Ken did such an amazing job. They really do have great chemistry together. The other actors and actresses were perfect! The set and the costume design were amazing and the Barbie World is accurate which I love. The dialogue is really funny and the musical numbers are just pure perfection. Absolutely adored Barbie. I did go to theaters to watch this movie and to my surprise, I saw a lot of young kids watching it. There was a lot of adult topics, such as sexism and problems women face in society, and the patriarchy and the matriarchy, and slightly inappropriate jokes that were put into the movie which I don't think kids should be watching. It seems like it's marketed towards young children when really, teenagers and adults are really the audience it was intended for. This was only a slight problem, and other than that, I think this movie was a masterpiece and definitely makes a great movie night. It was emotional but hilarious and relatable and Barbie won't disappoint.",i love barbi,barbi beauti funni relat movi i enjoy much margot robbi play barbi ryan gosl play ken amaz job they realli great chemistri togeth the actor actress perfect the set costum design amaz barbi world accur i love the dialogu realli funni music number pure perfect absolut ador barbi i go theater watch movi surpris i saw lot young kid watch there lot adult topic sexism problem woman face societi patriarchi matriarchi slightli inappropri joke put movi i dont think kid watch it seem like market toward young child realli teenag adult realli audienc intend thi slight problem i think movi masterpiec definit make great movi night it emot hilari relat barbi wont disappoint
It was what I expected,"The title by no means suggests that this movie was predictable. Greta Gerwig does a wonderful job making the 1 hour and 54 minutes enjoyable for a wide range of audiences (which was originally a worry of mine, as a movie centered around the Barbie doll franchise seemed a narrow area of public interest). Rather, following countless pre-release trailers, interviews, promotions, and marketing schemes, I had a general idea of what the movie could be about. In other words, I was not left surprised or awed by new and unexpected artistic choices.The movie I expected was a comedic, lighthearted adventure surrounding Barbie and her ""universe"" of Barbies and Kens (and Allan), a pink and perfect world of constant happiness and beauty, until something goes terribly wrong: Barbie starts becoming human. What would follow is a wacky adventure wherein Barbie would seek for a solution to her problem, and in doing so, finding what it means to be human; furthermore, what it means to be a woman in a ""world of men.""And this is more or less the framework of Gerwig's film. Of course, there are many other creative aspects that were not anticipated, and the way it built off of a beloved franchise was admirable, to say the least, and clever. Though I was not a big Barbie fan as a child, there were all kinds of Easter eggs referencing Barbie lore throughout the movie. Many would say this film did Barbie and her fans justice.Overall, I expected the film to be good. And that is what I thought of it: it was an enjoyable and entertaining movie, though would not be on a list of favorites.It didn't move me in the way I believed it intended to. Some moments were emotional, but it did not leave me with profound thoughts on the state of modern-day patriarchy, or the hardened corporate heart of society. Perhaps this was because it was very well cushioned by comedic dialogue and colorful, fun design, successfully softening the blow of the movie's larger themes.I also agree that it was quite preachy, and although there was power behind the speeches about the feminist struggle and the expectations of perfections in an imperfect world, it felt very heavy-handed (especially towards the end of the film).Despite how I feel about Barbie not living up to its full potential, I encourage everyone to watch it. Not just because my opinion really doesn't mean anything among the experiences of others, but because it deserves a chance at changing another person's mind.I fully support how Barbie encourages the breaking of gender norms and awareness and transparency about mental health. The arc Barbie follows is touching, brave, and familiar to all those experiencing the ups and downs of life's many paths. Ultimately, it is worth a watch, and certainly opens new doors for future filmmaking and marketing.",it i expect,the titl mean suggest movi predict greta gerwig wonder job make hour minut enjoy wide rang audienc origin worri mine movi center around barbi doll franchis seem narrow area public interest rather follow countless prereleas trailer interview promot market scheme i gener idea movi could in word i left surpris awe new unexpect artist choicesth movi i expect comed lightheart adventur surround barbi univers barbi ken allan pink perfect world constant happi beauti someth goe terribl wrong barbi start becom human what would follow wacki adventur wherein barbi would seek solut problem find mean human furthermor mean woman world menand le framework gerwig film of cours mani creativ aspect anticip way built belov franchis admir say least clever though i big barbi fan child kind easter egg referenc barbi lore throughout movi mani would say film barbi fan justiceoveral i expect film good and i thought enjoy entertain movi though would list favoritesit didnt move way i believ intend some moment emot leav profound thought state modernday patriarchi harden corpor heart societi perhap well cushion comed dialogu color fun design success soften blow movi larger themesi also agre quit preachi although power behind speech feminist struggl expect perfect imperfect world felt heavyhand especi toward end filmdespit i feel barbi live full potenti i encourag everyon watch not opinion realli doesnt mean anyth among experi other deserv chanc chang anoth person mindi fulli support barbi encourag break gender norm awar transpar mental health the arc barbi follow touch brave familiar experienc up down life mani path ultim worth watch certainli open new door futur filmmak market

Best picture ? Nah,"Its allright , but its a fresh idea and worth the hype. The story line is a little boring, the musics and dancing are excellent ! This is the definition of Gen Z movie , very up to date and very relatable to this generation. Very Easy to understand , you'll need a coffee to keep you wide awake if you're very critical to the movies . Ryan Gosling is absolutely a bait to the movie .

"A Great Beginning; After That, A Mixed Bag.","The opening sequence is such a precise, dead-on parody of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" that I had to give that segment alone an A+++, which factored in to my overall rating and upped it a notch. Actually, the first forty-five minutes to an hour of ""Barbie"" is pretty funny, with some good satire and surprisingly darker undertones, like Stereotypical Barbie mysteriously having thoughts about death, so that helped, too.Problem is, when Barbie & Ken (Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling) journey to the real world, the social commentary turns too serious and practically grinds the movie to a halt. Sometimes you're not sure if it's still parody or if they're trying to make a statement. And that pretty much takes the fun out of it.""Barbie"" is best when it makes fun of all prevailing gender stereotypes, instead of zeroing in on how women are oh, so burdened, being as they are, unfairly expected to be All Things To All People, & yada yada yada, giving the former Ugly Betty (America Ferrera) an opportunity to lecture us on the subject by delivering a preachy monologue. There are a few noteworthy moments in the second half, involving a Ken insurrection (a ""Kensurrection,"" perhaps?) and a side note on Barbie's origin with a nod to the doll's real-life creator Ruth Handler (Rhea Perlman), but by then the damage has been done.Watch the first hour for incisive, clever satire; after that, beware of banality.

An Extremely Clever and Entertaining Experience,"Well, if a film like The Lego Movie can come out and be clever and great, I guess a Barbie film can as well. I will always hesitate when a product receives a film based on it because it just seems shameful in terms of marketing. Audiences will always receive a few diamonds in the rough though, and Barbie is just that. It's definitely the most fun I've had at the movies this year. It's a lot more than just bright colours so let's get into it.To keep it simple, the film follows Barbie (Margot Robbie) as she realizes there is more to life than just living in Barbieland. Accompanied by Ken (Ryan Gosling), they venture to the real world. With many revelations about how awful our world is, the two of them discover what is both good and bad about life. I'm keeping it vague because what helps this simple story become a more complex one is the social commentary and incredibly funny humour. I was laughing hysterically throughout and I was genuinely moved by the end.Certain viewers may find some of the messages to be heavy-handed, but I didn't. In fact, I found that the messages actually made the film better overall. Yes, it's a film that explores equal rights, but it does so in a fashion that doesn't downgrade anyone, but rather puts others on a higher pedestal. I really liked how the film handled all of the issues it presented. I shouldn't have been too surprised though, because Greta Gerwig as a director is just fabulous.Having liked both Lady Bird and Little Women, Gerwig has continued to impress me as a director, even if I haven't exactly loved any of her films yet. Well, I believe her efforts here made the best film of her career to date. There are so many different variations of Ken and Barbie and the performances she pulls out of each and every one of these performers was nothing short of great. I mean, with that said, it didn't hurt that the cast was perfection.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are terrific as always and are obviously the main reason to see this film on the surface, but America Ferrera and Simu Liu were also standouts to me. Each character either had a dramatic or comedic moment that stood out and I couldn't get enough of the whole cast. Michael Cera as Allen is gold as well, but in the end, this is a film that all came down to the screenplay. Yes, the set design is award-worthy, the musical number is worthy of an Oscar-nomination, but Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach crafted a genius script here. The nuances throughout are what sent this film over the edge for me. Their attention to detail was perfect here. I highly recommend Barbie to all ages and genders.",an extrem clever entertain experi,well film like the lego movi come clever great i guess barbi film well i alway hesit product receiv film base seem shame term market audienc alway receiv diamond rough though barbi it definit fun ive movi year it lot bright colour let get itto keep simpl film follow barbi margot robbi realiz life live barbieland accompani ken ryan gosl ventur real world with mani revel aw world two discov good bad life im keep vagu help simpl stori becom complex one social commentari incred funni humour i laugh hyster throughout i genuin move endcertain viewer may find messag heavyhand i didnt in fact i found messag actual made film better overal ye film explor equal right fashion doesnt downgrad anyon rather put other higher pedest i realli like film handl issu present i shouldnt surpris though greta gerwig director fabuloushav like ladi bird littl woman gerwig continu impress director even i havent exactli love film yet well i believ effort made best film career date there mani differ variat ken barbi perform pull everi one perform noth short great i mean said didnt hurt cast perfectionmargot robbi ryan gosl terrif alway obvious main reason see film surfac america ferrera simu liu also standout each charact either dramat comed moment stood i couldnt get enough whole cast michael cera allen gold well end film came screenplay ye set design awardworthi music number worthi oscarnomin greta gerwig noah baumbach craft geniu script the nuanc throughout sent film edg their attent detail perfect i highli recommend barbi age gender
Funny,"Funny.I think if I had experienced with Barbie as a child, I would have gotten more into it, but even without that, it's fun.The music was so good, which made the silliness stand out. I watched the movie in the theater with good speakers, so the floor was shaking during the end roll because of the bass. What is this, here is a club?I thought afterwards that it's like. Greta Celeste Garwig, who has been (seemingly) straight point so far, is suddenly swinging a nail-bat in many directions, and that's part of the fun.It's a good movie to give a stir in this world(especially in Japan).Warner needs to reflect.",funni,funnyi think i experienc barbi child i would gotten even without funth music good made silli stand i watch movi theater good speaker floor shake end roll bass what clubi thought afterward like greta celest garwig seemingli straight point far suddenli swing nailbat mani direct that part funit good movi give stir worldespeci japanwarn need reflect

I don't really enjoy it when a highly extravaganted issues is being shoved into my face. I honestly cannot understand how the producers thought that's the way to do it. It leaves a bitter taste behind and destroys the good vibes from the beginning of the movie.

Surpassed My Expectations,"I did not know what to expect from the Barbie movie when I went with my two adult daughters. I was very pleasantly surprised! The movie made me laugh and it sometimes brought a tear to my eye (but I mostly laughed through it). The sets are spectacular. I would not be surprised if the movie wins an Academy Award for at least the set design. Ryan Gosling is very funny as the underrated Ken and Margot Robbie is very well suited to play the iconic doll. A very good commentary on how, sometimes, the Real World works. The story was, at times, very touching, but it's mostly a really good time.

"Good Cinematography, Delusional Plot and Message","Very entertaining, and fun. Does not take itself too seriously. Very good satirical acting. Props, and set building is very creative and in-depth. Ryan Gosling is great, and really funny. The plot and message are annoying though. Starts from the beginning with a very delusional message, and does not let up. Even though I tried to ignore the very delusional message throughout, the ending makes no sense. Barbie herself ends up not solving her problem, still being confused, and staying in the real world when she wanted everything back to normal during the whole movie. That makes no sense whatsoever. The very last line of dialogue is a fail of a joke too. The director obviously did not know how to end the movie.",good cinematographi delusion plot messag,veri entertain fun doe take serious veri good satir act prop set build creativ indepth ryan gosl great realli funni the plot messag annoy though start begin delusion messag let even though i tri ignor delusion messag throughout end make sen barbi end solv problem still confus stay real world want everyth back normal whole movi that make sen whatsoev the last line dialogu fail joke the director obvious know end movi
Nothing short of brilliant - could be a game-changer,"Barbie is an anomaly, a force of nature, and could potentially be some sort of trendsetter in ways I can't quite fathom yet. I never expected a good Barbie movie to exist, especially not one that is so poignant and rich with satire, ambition, and intellect. But, this movie isn't just good - it's fantastic.Choosing to make ""facade"" one of the primary focuses of the film was probably the most brilliant thing that writer/director Greta Gerwig could have done, because it allows the movie to function as a wholly progressive and often quite meta experience. Though the movie only goes back and forth between Barbie Land and ""reality"", I felt as if I traversed through 5 or 6 different dimensions throughout the course of the film. The movie has so many layers, I'm not even sure how Gerwig made it work - maybe it was luck, maybe it was an incredibly talented cast & crew, or maybe she's just a genius.What's most important is that the movie is hilarious, all the way through. There weren't many segments where a giant smile was not plastered across my face. Though the choices for comedic roles could be perceived as cliche, all of them murdered the game with their characters, that being Michael Cera as Allan, Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie, and of course Will Ferrell as the CEO of Mattel. But, it's Ryan Gosling that truly steals the show as the funniest part of the entire film. Of course, it's the brilliant writing that allows it, but Gosling's commitment to bringing to life one of the greatest exaggerations of masculinity I have ever seen put to screen is diamond-level. The way the movie spotlights parallels between straight-guy masculinity and gayness, as both a joke and an astute observation, is incredible and done in a way I've never seen pulled off before.It should be said that what allows a comedy to transcend the bone-headed standards that the genre usually plants itself in, is a script that actually has something to say, from the heart and from the brain. I figured it would poke fun at certain gender tropes and politics, but I didn't expect Barbie to be full of so much existential philosophy. At times it almost felt like Charlie Kaufman LITE, but in a GOOD WAY. Though most of the film is full of laughs, it also has several segments that will suddenly take you to realms of sheer reflection and a surprising amount of emotional resonance. I think a lot of people had to get over an ""am I about to cry at a Barbie movie?"" hump, but...I want you to know that you should cry at this movie! It's both nostalgic and totally ahead of its time at the same time. It's actually a very serious and important film underneath all the pink & the laughs.And on that note, it's not surprising that so many dudes are already calling it a horrible movie and overly woke feminist propaganda, but it's definitely lame of them, and in my opinion, wrong. I think a lot of these people are missing a lot of the points and the jokes. Though on the surface the movie seems to be poking most fun at men, it pokes just as much fun at femininity, society, and the human experience as a whole. It has a lot of critical things to say about all of them. Plus, if you can't laugh at your own kind, especially when it's done so articulately, with so much love, I really think you're doing it all wrong.It comes as no surprise that Margot Robbie carries the film wonderfully. The soundtrack is also a ton of fun. But the most exciting part here, ""as a fan of the cinema"", is knowing that this is going to take Greta Gerwig to the absolute top of the totem pole. She's been such an interesting, tasteful, and likable multi-faceted presence, between acting, writing, and directing, and I'm very curious and excited to see what she does with her power after this.",noth short brilliant could gamechang,barbi anomali forc natur could potenti sort trendsett way i cant quit fathom yet i never expect good barbi movi exist especi one poignant rich satir ambit intellect but movi isnt good fantasticchoos make facad one primari focus film probabl brilliant thing writerdirector greta gerwig could done allow movi function wholli progress often quit meta experi though movi goe back forth barbi land realiti i felt i travers differ dimens throughout cours film the movi mani layer im even sure gerwig made work mayb luck mayb incred talent cast crew mayb she geniuswhat import movi hilari way there werent mani segment giant smile plaster across face though choic comed role could perceiv clich murder game charact michael cera allan kate mckinnon weird barbi cours will ferrel ceo mattel but ryan gosl truli steal show funniest part entir film of cours brilliant write allow gosl commit bring life one greatest exagger masculin i ever seen put screen diamondlevel the way movi spotlight parallel straightguy masculin gay joke astut observ incred done way ive never seen pull beforeit said allow comedi transcend bonehead standard genr usual plant script actual someth say heart brain i figur would poke fun certain gender trope polit i didnt expect barbi full much existenti philosophi at time almost felt like charli kaufman lite good way though film full laugh also sever segment suddenli take realm sheer reflect surpris amount emot reson i think lot peopl get i cri barbi movi hump buti want know cri movi it nostalg total ahead time time it actual seriou import film underneath pink laughsand note surpris mani dude alreadi call horribl movi overli woke feminist propaganda definit lame opinion wrong i think lot peopl miss lot point joke though surfac movi seem poke fun men poke much fun feminin societi human experi whole it lot critic thing say plu cant laugh kind especi done articul much love i realli think your wrongit come surpris margot robbi carri film wonder the soundtrack also ton fun but excit part fan cinema know go take greta gerwig absolut top totem pole she interest tast likabl multifacet presenc act write direct im curiou excit see power
Barbie (2023) - Surprisingly Heartwarming and Entertaining!,"When I first heard about the release of ""Barbie"" in 2023, I must admit I didn't have high expectations. After all, it's a movie based on a doll beloved by generations of young girls, and I wasn't sure how that would translate into a compelling cinematic experience. However, I was in for a pleasant surprise!The direction of the film was truly on point. It managed to take a simple concept and turn it into a captivating story with well-paced storytelling. The director skillfully brought Barbie's world to life, giving the audience a fresh and exciting perspective on the iconic toy.One of the standout aspects of the movie was its ability to balance comedy and heart. The inclusion of good comic punchlines added a delightful layer of humor, ensuring that the film appeals to both young and older audiences. It's no easy feat to strike the right balance in a movie like this, but ""Barbie"" managed to do just that.The performances by the actors were commendable. Despite the unconventional nature of portraying a doll on the big screen, all the actors played their parts exceptionally well. They breathed life into their characters and made the audience emotionally invested in their journey.What impressed me the most was the emotional depth that the movie managed to achieve. Considering it is based on a toy, it could have been easy to dismiss it as a mere cash-grab with no real substance. However, ""Barbie"" proved me wrong by exploring meaningful themes and evoking genuine emotions. It touched on friendship, self-discovery, and the importance of staying true to oneself - messages that resonate not only with children but also with adults.In conclusion, ""Barbie"" surpassed my expectations and delivered an enjoyable and heartwarming cinematic experience. It's a movie that manages to entertain with its humor and engaging storytelling, while also providing valuable life lessons. Whether you're a fan of the iconic doll or not, ""Barbie"" is a film that will leave you with a smile on your face and a warm feeling in your heart.It's a solid 7.3 for me.",barbi surprisingli heartwarm entertain,when i first heard releas barbi i must admit i didnt high expect after movi base doll belov gener young girl i wasnt sure would translat compel cinemat experi howev i pleasant surpriseth direct film truli point it manag take simpl concept turn captiv stori wellpac storytel the director skill brought barbi world life give audienc fresh excit perspect icon toyon standout aspect movi abil balanc comedi heart the inclus good comic punchlin ad delight layer humor ensur film appeal young older audienc it easi feat strike right balanc movi like barbi manag thatth perform actor commend despit unconvent natur portray doll big screen actor play part except well they breath life charact made audienc emot invest journeywhat impress emot depth movi manag achiev consid base toy could easi dismiss mere cashgrab real substanc howev barbi prove wrong explor meaning theme evok genuin emot it touch friendship selfdiscoveri import stay true oneself messag reson child also adultsin conclus barbi surpass expect deliv enjoy heartwarm cinemat experi it movi manag entertain humor engag storytel also provid valuabl life lesson whether your fan icon doll barbi film leav smile face warm feel heartit solid

Close Kenough,"7.5/10
First of all, I really loved this movie. I think it's fun and entertaining and I really think it's done with a lot a passion for the original material. The references are clever and I couldn't help but smile each time I saw a Barbie I had as a child (specially Midge!! I loved her). It's a very colorful movie and it's so refreshing to see that, specially with all the ""gray"" movies we get nowadays. The characters in Barbie land are fun and innocent, it really captures the joy of a child playing with the dolls even in the way it's filmed, the way the characters and objects move and even the houses are just like the ones you could play with as a child. Plus I really loved Ken and I think Ryan Gosling did a great job, he was hilarious. The Kens shenanigans were the best parts of the movie for me.However this movie could have been an almost perfect movie if it wasn't for the real world parts and the messaging at the end of the movie.First of all, the real world is extremely exaggerated and they were really pushing the political view they had in this part.The scene where a man simply smacks Barbie out of nowhere is very unnecessary and it ruins the beautiful parts were Barbie is trying to feel and understand the real world around her like with the old lady at the bus stop (that part is just perfect and captures the essence of the real and beautiful complexity of real world feelings). More so, the parts with the mother and the teenage daughter could have been way better and I really didn't like them coming to the Barbie world. The ""deprogramming all the barbies"" was too forced for me and I would prefer if Barbie herself did that.Which leads me to the final part, the politics.After seeing the real world 'patriarchy"", Ken, a character that lived his whole life just to please Barbie and is nothing more than an accessory to her, finally feels appreciated for the first time in his life and brings the patriarchy to his own world because of that. Is he right? No, of course not. But I think it was actually a logical thing for him to do in that moment. And, for me, the movie was going to acknowledge that at the end. But it didn't. I mean, it did a little bit, but not enough in my opinion. It would have been awesome if the Barbies and kens came together at the end and decided to create a better society for both of them. But instead they chose to make a joke that ""the Kens will someday have just as much power as the women in the real world..."" It really missed the point of making Barbie land and lost the opportunity to make an inspiring example for the real world, one that helps the oppressed and makes equal opportunities for both men and women.Anyway, this my review of the movie and in conclusion: Close Kenough to a perfect movie.",close kenough,first i realli love movi i think fun entertain i realli think done lot passion origin materi the refer clever i couldnt help smile time i saw barbi i child special midg i love it color movi refresh see special gray movi get nowaday the charact barbi land fun innoc realli captur joy child play doll even way film way charact object move even hous like one could play child plu i realli love ken i think ryan gosl great job hilari the ken shenanigan best part movi mehowev movi could almost perfect movi wasnt real world part messag end moviefirst real world extrem exagger realli push polit view partth scene man simpli smack barbi nowher unnecessari ruin beauti part barbi tri feel understand real world around like old ladi bu stop part perfect captur essenc real beauti complex real world feel more part mother teenag daughter could way better i realli didnt like come barbi world the deprogram barbi forc i would prefer barbi thatwhich lead final part politicsaft see real world patriarchi ken charact live whole life plea barbi noth accessori final feel appreci first time life bring patriarchi world is right no cours but i think actual logic thing moment and movi go acknowledg end but didnt i mean littl bit enough opinion it would awesom barbi ken came togeth end decid creat better societi but instead chose make joke ken someday much power woman real world it realli miss point make barbi land lost opportun make inspir exampl real world one help oppress make equal opportun men womenanyway review movi conclus close kenough perfect movi

A Commentary In Film On the Issues of Gender Equality and Disparity in Our Generation...Oh and Barbie!,"I feel like, after watching the movie, Barbie is one of those movies where the trailer doesn't really fully explain what you're going to be getting in the feature film.Although there are some legitimately funny moments, particularly when Barbie feels the need to correct anatomical assumptions made about her and Ken - for Ken to then sheepishly defend his manliness.Of course the costumes and scenery in Barbieland are outstanding. The mix of reality and 'imaginative play' that everyone who has ever played with Barbie recognises is very clever. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling fill their respective roles perfectly.If you're sensing that I'm working my way up to a 'but', you're dead on!BUT. The movie feels very much like a platform for a social commentary and less like a joyous celebration of a childhood icon.I have no issue at all with films containing more serious undertones (see my review of the latest Indiana Jones movie). I think it speaks to excellent writing and directing when a film has both surface layers and subcutaneous elements because then there really is something for everyone!However Barbie is heavy on the social commentary and light on the escapism. All of this leaves you feeling a little....shall I say bombarded?Of course, films that make serious and sometimes uncomfortable observations about society do have their place. Yet we like to know what we're getting into before we hit the play button.Barbie felt a little bit like taking a drink and expecting it to be a sweet refreshing lemonade and actually getting a triple espresso.

One to pass time during a flight...,"The film boasts stunning visuals and a standout performance by Michael Cera. However, Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and Will Ferrell's presence felt out of place in their respective roles. While I admired its message advocating for gender equality and challenging the patriarchy, the execution came off as overly simplistic and reductive. The handling of these crucial themes felt disjointed, resulting in a somewhat exhausting two-hour experience. It's an important film, and I'm pleased with its success, yet it fits more into the category of a movie for passing time during a flight.

Barbie,"This movie captures the frustrating yet wonderful feeling of being a woman in this world more than any other film I feel so seen and acknowledged. I ended up crying as the credits rolled just because I felt like all the emotions I couldn't put into words and no one could ever understand were said in this film. This is a movie for everyone, not just women, it makes us reflect about power roles and how we should all work together towards a more equal world for all.Unlike what some people might believe it is not ""anti men"" the whole point of Ken's story line is how he learns toxic masculinity is dangerous, not only for women but for men as well and just end up causing harm. In the end he learns he is more than just a partner and must find meaning in his life being his own person.

Surprisingly well-layered,"Barbie has captured many nuances of the societal stereotypes, challenged these tenets with a tactful yet fun twist. The main standout truly is the costume design. Highly diverse yet coherently put together to honor the Barbie concept.

Fun to watch!,"I really enjoyed watching Barbie (2023) by Greta Gerwig. For the first time. The music grabbed my attention right away and set the mood for a movie with excellent cinematography. The color grading looks amazing and goes well with the story of the film. Visual storytelling is important in Barbie's self-discovery trip, which is interestingly mirrored by Ken's own existential questions.Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie being cast as Ken and Barbie is really exciting. They play their roles with charm and ease, which makes the movie enjoyable. Barbie (2023) is an interesting movie that has some flaws, but it is entertaining and provides a different take on discovering who you are.Furthermore, although the movie's approach to feminism is thoughtful, it doesn't fully capture the importance and complexity of the subject. Feminism and women's rights, being profoundly important throughout history and in contemporary society, require a detailed and nuanced exploration. While the film attempts to delve into these significant themes, it ultimately approaches them in a manner that is more general and stereotypical, rather than deeply insightful and detailed.In conclusion, Barbie (2023) is a really cool movie with amazing visuals and great acting, especially from Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie. Although it explores complex themes, its handling of sensitive topics like feminism and political discourse lacks the depth and nuance required.",fun watch,i realli enjoy watch barbi greta gerwig for first time the music grab attent right away set mood movi excel cinematographi the color grade look amaz goe well stori film visual storytel import barbi selfdiscoveri trip interestingli mirror ken existenti questionsryan gosl margot robbi cast ken barbi realli excit they play role charm ea make movi enjoy barbi interest movi flaw entertain provid differ take discov arefurthermor although movi approach femin thought doesnt fulli captur import complex subject femin woman right profoundli import throughout histori contemporari societi requir detail nuanc explor while film attempt delv signific theme ultim approach manner gener stereotyp rather deepli insight detailedin conclus barbi realli cool movi amaz visual great act especi ryan gosl margot robbi although explor complex theme handl sensit topic like femin polit discours lack depth nuanc requir
Started Strong But Ended Weak,"The Barbie movie was overall highly enjoyable. The costumes and sets were great and added to the Barbie nostalgia. Ken was probably my favorite part, watching him go through the ups and downs of unrequited love, and finally finding himself outside of Barbie at the end of the movie. I even enjoyed the over-the-top portrayal of the patriarchy. It was hilarious. However, I felt the ending fell flat. Maybe they were trying to show how ridiculous the patriarchy was by putting in reverse, but I felt like they acted too dismissive of the plight of the Kens, to the point that it didn't feel satirical but rather like actually not acknowledging them and their voice at all. It felt like in giving women power and a voice they ended up actually mistreating the Kens and laughing it off as funny. Sure, they gave them some minor administrative role at the end, but the attitude when they did it was just so very wrong. Like it ended with the Barbies doing exactly what we complain about men in society doing to women. Not that it happened in the middle as part of their growth. It happened as part of the finale. The final focus of the film. Overall, I highly enjoyed the movie, but the ending really made me leave feeling let down.",start strong but end weak,the barbi movi overal highli enjoy the costum set great ad barbi nostalgia ken probabl favorit part watch go up down unrequit love final find outsid barbi end movi i even enjoy overthetop portray patriarchi it hilari howev i felt end fell flat mayb tri show ridicul patriarchi put revers i felt like act dismiss plight ken point didnt feel satir rather like actual acknowledg voic it felt like give woman power voic end actual mistreat ken laugh funni sure gave minor administr role end attitud wrong like end barbi exactli complain men societi woman not happen middl part growth it happen part final the final focu film overal i highli enjoy movi end realli made leav feel let
Just ok - end falls flat,"Although the Barbie movie's funny bits were good for one viewing, and there were several funny bits throughout the film, I think the writer/director wrote herself into a corner so the ending just falls flat. The parodies were funny, and the contrasts with real life were funny, but the writers just didn't know where to go with the story in the end. A lot of Greta Gerwig's films are like that. Disappointing. I wouldn't see the Barbie movie more than once, which is sad, because I've seen Dial of Destiny four times, and I am going back for a fifth viewing. That film did not disappoint! This one could have been a lot better.",just ok end fall flat,although barbi movi funni bit good one view sever funni bit throughout film i think writerdirector wrote corner end fall flat the parodi funni contrast real life funni writer didnt know go stori end a lot greta gerwig film like disappoint i wouldnt see barbi movi sad ive seen dial destini four time i go back fifth view that film disappoint thi one could lot better
"""Sublime!"" -Ken, 2023","One of the most affectionately crafted and truly hilarious films of all time!Usually, a slight exhale through my nose is enough for me to classify a movie as funny but 'Barbie' had me laughing loud enough to annoy the whole cinema. It was jam-packed with line after line after line of hilarity - I couldn't even get a chance to catch my breath! Greta Gerwig's script had me snorting and crying from laughter, especially when paired with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's flawless delivery of it.'Barbie' was full of such in-touch and specific references that the whole audience could relate to. From the Kens mansplaining 'The Godfather' to the inclusion of Weird Barbie who'd been ""played with too hard"", Gerwig made the film feel highly personal, which is quite a feat considering the impersonal nature of the subject of the movie.But it was more than just a comedy; the film touched on much deeper themes of feminism and existentialism. When Barbie left the matriarchy of Barbie Land and entered the Real World, the film acted as a political and social commentary on issues surrounding misogyny and womanhood. With Gerwig's depiction of not only what it means to be a woman, but also what it means to be human, she beautifully and skillfully brought the humanity to a plastic doll.The set design, casting, acting, writing and directing were all executed phenomenally and came together to create a poignant, multifaceted and rollicking movie.

"Mixed Bag: Good Moments, Simplistic Themes","As far as I'm concerned, the first half of the movie was simply boring to me, and the attempts at humor on that level were just UGH. Yes, the message is fine, though very simplified - men bad, women good. I agree that equality is important, and I liked the conclusion that Kens need to find their own purpose. Of course, I didn't miss the gay undertones with the Kens (flexing on the beach with beers and the Grease-like choreography where a black and yellow Ken give Gosling kisses on the cheeks and then shake it off with a ""what was that"" - I'd gladly pay a ticket for that action 😜), and there's also a gay vibe with Allan and the cubicle guy from Mattel... I also liked Weird Barbie and Ruth. The Mattel board was a very coarse caricature to me.All in all, a ""mixed bag"" - there are good moments, but the bad ones outweigh them for me. I don't regret watching it, but I wouldn't do it again.It's symptomatic to me that an Oppenheimer barely collects 650 million, and these guys double that, and it'll probably be even more...
And that bit at the end with the gynecologist... I expected Barbie to get a job at Mattel as the new Ruth, but no: the message to the girls was to go to the gynecologist... facepalm....",mix bag good moment simplist theme,a far im concern first half movi simpli bore attempt humor level ugh ye messag fine though simplifi men bad woman good i agre equal import i like conclus ken need find purpos of cours i didnt miss gay underton ken flex beach beer greaselik choreographi black yellow ken give gosl kiss cheek shake id gladli pay ticket action there also gay vibe allan cubicl guy mattel i also like weird barbi ruth the mattel board coars caricatur meall mix bag good moment bad one outweigh i dont regret watch i wouldnt againit symptomat oppenheim bare collect million guy doubl itll probabl even and bit end gynecologist i expect barbi get job mattel new ruth messag girl go gynecologist facepalm
Barbie,"The 2023 movie ""Barbie"" is a surprisingly subversive and thought-provoking film that takes a sharp look at gender roles and expectations. Directed by Greta Gerwig and starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, the film has good visual with a sharp script and great performances.The film follows Barbie (Robbie) as she is exiled from Barbieland for not being perfect enough. She ends up in the real world, where she meets Ken (Gosling) and learns about the challenges of being a woman in a patriarchal society.The film is full of humor and heart, but it also tackles some serious issues, such as sexism, body image, and the pressure to conform. Gerwig does a good job of balancing these elements, creating a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking.The performances in the film are all excellent. Robbie is particularly good as Barbie, bringing both humor and vulnerability to the role. Gosling is also great as Ken, and the two have great chemistry together.The film's visuals are also stunning. The sets are nicely designed, and the costumes are good. It's clear that a lot of care went into its production.Kids seem to love it and it's really a film for them even if I wouldn't watch it a second time personally.",barbi,the movi barbi surprisingli subvers thoughtprovok film take sharp look gender role expect direct greta gerwig star margot robbi ryan gosl film good visual sharp script great performancesth film follow barbi robbi exil barbieland perfect enough she end real world meet ken gosl learn challeng woman patriarch societyth film full humor heart also tackl seriou issu sexism bodi imag pressur conform gerwig good job balanc element creat film entertain thoughtprovokingth perform film excel robbi particularli good barbi bring humor vulner role gosl also great ken two great chemistri togetherth film visual also stun the set nice design costum good it clear lot care went productionkid seem love realli film even i wouldnt watch second time person
Ken out of 10,"Barbie exceeds all expectations, delivering a self-aware and meta comedy that appeals to both devoted fans and newcomers. The film's profound layers and sharp humor create an immensely satisfying experience, showcasing the best version of Barbie on a grand scale while embracing its wonderfully weird and unique qualities.Margot Robbie's casting as Barbie is spot-on, effortlessly transitioning between the eccentric Barbie Land and the emotionally charged real world. Her performance masterfully captures the character's essence, while her dynamic with Gosling's Ken adds depth and a touching parental undertone.Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken is nothing short of phenomenal. It's a note-perfect casting choice that allows him to showcase his impeccable comedic timing, reminiscent of his role in The Nice Guys, but dialed up to a whole new level. His character's journey culminates in a side-splittingly funny musical number.Will Ferrell, channeling his Lord Business persona, leads a hilariously caricatured team of executives in Barbie Land. This satire effectively highlights their out-of-touch nature, offering a clever commentary on corporate culture.America Ferrara's impactful speech and her heartwarming bond with Ariana Greenblatt contribute a layer of sincerity to the film. This relationship beautifully acknowledges Barbie's history while infusing the narrative with genuine emotion.Greta Gerwig's direction shines with a well-deserved bigger budget, evident in the stunning dance sequences, exhilarating car chase, and vibrant Barbie Land. The film's artificial nature paradoxically enhances its visual realism, setting it apart from conventional offerings.The soundtrack stands out with a stellar lineup of songs from top-tier artists. These tracks, much like the film itself, range from joyfully fun to deeply meaningful, seamlessly enhancing the overall experience. Barbie's music perfectly complements its narrative, creating a harmonious blend that resonates long after the credits roll.",ken,barbi exce expect deliv selfawar meta comedi appeal devot fan newcom the film profound layer sharp humor creat immens satisfi experi showcas best version barbi grand scale embrac wonder weird uniqu qualitiesmargot robbi cast barbi spoton effortlessli transit eccentr barbi land emot charg real world her perform master captur charact essenc dynam gosl ken add depth touch parent undertoneryan gosl portray ken noth short phenomen it noteperfect cast choic allow showcas impecc comed time reminisc role the nice guy dial whole new level hi charact journey culmin sidesplittingli funni music numberwil ferrel channel lord busi persona lead hilari caricatur team execut barbi land thi satir effect highlight outoftouch natur offer clever commentari corpor cultureamerica ferrara impact speech heartwarm bond ariana greenblatt contribut layer sincer film thi relationship beauti acknowledg barbi histori infus narr genuin emotiongreta gerwig direct shine welldeserv bigger budget evid stun danc sequenc exhilar car chase vibrant barbi land the film artifici natur paradox enhanc visual realism set apart convent offeringsth soundtrack stand stellar lineup song toptier artist these track much like film rang joy fun deepli meaning seamlessli enhanc overal experi barbi music perfectli complement narr creat harmoni blend reson long credit roll
A fun movie with a tiny bit of complexity,"The film is an enchanting mixture of sitcom, satire on consumer society and philosophy, where they dragged in everything they possibly could: from Pinocchio to the Bible. At the same time, the movie seems like a sketch from a talkshow that parodies cliches associated with the Barbie subculture.All the most important things happen towards the end, when Barbie faces a dilemma on a universal scale: to remain a doll in an ideal doll world or to become a real (""ordinary"") person. There is no single correct choice here. You either live in a delusional bliss or face the harsh reality.In general, the impression of the film can be expressed in a phrase: they wanted to say a lot of things at once, but along the way they also got lost in their grandiose attempt at philosophy. Nevertheless, the film turned out to be funny. Adults will enjoy reading the philosophical ideas hidden here. And for children there is a bright, dynamic story and several smart ideas presented in understandable language.",a fun movi tini bit complex,the film enchant mixtur sitcom satir consum societi philosophi drag everyth possibl could pinocchio bibl at time movi seem like sketch talkshow parodi clich associ barbi subcultureal import thing happen toward end barbi face dilemma univers scale remain doll ideal doll world becom real ordinari person there singl correct choic you either live delusion bliss face harsh realityin gener impress film express phrase want say lot thing along way also got lost grandios attempt philosophi nevertheless film turn funni adult enjoy read philosoph idea hidden and child bright dynam stori sever smart idea present understand languag
Biggest Movie but not the best of 2023,"Barbie was definitely the biggest movie to come out in 2023, with the hype train in full flow before the release. The cast was perfect and the soundtrack across multiple artists all running to get a bite of the cherry was also quite good, most hit the charts upon release.The story of the film hits home the meaning of Barbie, on how she can be anything or do any career she wants to do in a time when Barbie was released as a toy, women were still trying to get a foot on the world and this really hits home in the film.Very good ending and our stereotypical Barbie is actually the least stereotypical as she gains a form of conscience after embarking out into the real world and begins to question her existence.Definitely the biggest release of 2023, a very funny and quirky adaption of our well known Toy Barbie.",biggest movi best,barbi definit biggest movi come hype train full flow releas the cast perfect soundtrack across multipl artist run get bite cherri also quit good hit chart upon releaseth stori film hit home mean barbi anyth career want time barbi releas toy woman still tri get foot world realli hit home filmveri good end stereotyp barbi actual least stereotyp gain form conscienc embark real world begin question existencedefinit biggest releas funni quirki adapt well known toy barbi
Strange but it has its positives,"Barbie was certainly unique. It has a simple plot which well fits its target youth audience, it does have moments of comedy but don't expect any other sorts of genres. Both Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie give a good performance which is convincing at times but not always. Greta Gerwig sometimes shows reasonably interesting and unique cinematography however most of the shots and music are predictable. This movie was packed with a star studded cast which lives it up to a greater name than it deserves. If you have young children they will certainly enjoy it, but if not I wouldn't recommend it to you.",strang posit,barbi certainli uniqu it simpl plot well fit target youth audienc moment comedi dont expect sort genr both ryan gosl margot robbi give good perform convinc time alway greta gerwig sometim show reason interest uniqu cinematographi howev shot music predict thi movi pack star stud cast live greater name deserv if young child certainli enjoy i wouldnt recommend
It's not what I expected but in a good way,"The movie in my opinion is great, it's no Godfather but it's a movie about BARBIE it's supposed to be fun, easy going and delightful but also amazingly brings up the problems of todays women and MEN. It has a great portrayal of the difference between the barbie world and the real human world. The characters are weirdly relatable and understandable. Margot Robbie was the best pick for barbie and Ryan as Ken ( even tho some may disagree, but no just watch the movie he is perfect) it's really funny but also in some scenes very sad and relatable. I recommend watching this movie because of :
1. Humour the ending really caught me off guard ngl 😂
2. The movie not being dragged out and hard to watch
3. Interesting storyline even tho there are still those smarts that think it's basic. It's not. It made me realise some sadder things about characters like Ken and think about the human world
4. Message you gotta watch the movie for this one 😏
5. Great acting, dancing and yesss even singing its a bit basic and cheesy to put this to the list but I find it really impressive on how natural a human can act like a barbie.6.

"Goood movie, bad plot","While this movie is worth seeing and contains some humorous moments, as well as Ryan goslings 'I'm just Ken' being one of the highlights, I wasn't a fan of the men vs women portrayal, and the plot wasn't the best. For example, why did the Mattel board chase barbie into barbieland when what they wanted was for her to go back there and how did the Ken's brainwash intelligent barbies in such a short period of time. Also some of the references were a bit obscure and the end dragged on for at least 10 minutes too long. However it is worth noting that the costume and set design was astonishing and enhanced the experience of the movie.",goood movi bad plot,while movi worth see contain humor moment well ryan gosl im ken one highlight i wasnt fan men v woman portray plot wasnt best for exampl mattel board chase barbi barbieland want go back ken brainwash intellig barbi short period time also refer bit obscur end drag least minut long howev worth note costum set design astonish enhanc experi movi
10yo and 12yo girls had no idea what was going on,"The sign that a film is of no interest to my daughter is when she starts doing something else instead of watching it. This was clearly not a film of interest to her.She's the only one who still plays with Barbies at home, but the story was very hard for her to follow, and there wasn't enough fun for kids her age, she just rolled on the floor and did other things rather than watch.I'm not sure who the movie was for, possibly 40-50yo women?I feel like I've been sucked in by some serious marketing skills because at some point over Christmas I felt that this was a film that I really had to see, then after about 10 minutes I was wondering why on earth I was watching it, and this feeling was vindicated as the movie progressed,",yo yo girl idea go,the sign film interest daughter start someth el instead watch thi clearli film interest hersh one still play barbi home stori hard follow wasnt enough fun kid age roll floor thing rather watchim sure movi possibl yo womeni feel like ive suck seriou market skill point christma i felt film i realli see minut i wonder earth i watch feel vindic movi progress
Fabulously done,"So, I didn't have that much of a high expectation going in to see this because I really wasn't sure what is was going to be. I grew up playing Barbie's and have watched the animated films many times with my kids.The movie from start to finish is so thoughtfully executed. It's for everyone, but mainly young girls need to see this. It's a great reminder of how special we are as women and how special ALL of us are individually as a person and the life we get to experience.Another fantastic element is adding a very 90s feel to the film. You will laugh like you used to laugh when fun comedies would come out in theatre's years ago. I haven't seen just a good comedy with heart in years.I brought my 7yr old and we dressed up for it too. I wanted her to see me comfortable in my own skin and her as well and the film touches on that. It's suited for any age, regardless of the rating.I don't give high ratings like this to films usually, as I find small things usually that I wish had been addressed more... but not in Barbie. What a fun movie and a great time you'll have watching this in theatre (or at home) knowing it's your childhood come to life.",fabul done,so i didnt much high expect go see i realli wasnt sure go i grew play barbi watch anim film mani time kidsth movi start finish thought execut it everyon mainli young girl need see it great remind special woman special all u individu person life get experienceanoth fantast element ad feel film you laugh like use laugh fun comedi would come theatr year ago i havent seen good comedi heart yearsi brought yr old dress i want see comfort skin well film touch it suit age regardless ratingi dont give high rate like film usual i find small thing usual i wish address barbi what fun movi great time youll watch theatr home know childhood come life
Great potential but messy closure,"Up to 80% of the storyline the film was great and tapped into essential topics of personal development and gender identities, reflecting and criticising society. The cast and characters had flair in the right amount of depth and dimensionality as well as chemistry amongst them. Also great that by the time the choreographed dancing scene(s) came in, the viewer had gotten the chance to properly care about what had been building up and then, the songs had real impact. It made for some good fun and laughs.As for the remaining 20%, it felt the makers did not know how to tie everything up and went for a shallow symbolic move which was very blurry and loose.",great potenti messi closur,up storylin film great tap essenti topic person develop gender ident reflect criticis societi the cast charact flair right amount depth dimension well chemistri amongst also great time choreograph danc scene came viewer gotten chanc properli care build song real impact it made good fun laughsa remain felt maker know tie everyth went shallow symbol move blurri loo
Ryan gosling is the best part of this movie,"This movie is a feminist fever dream that teaches young girls that they will never be successful in the world as long as men exist, and that men are horrible, ironically Ken played by Ryan Gosling is the best part of this movie, bringing more laughs than anything else.The movie gets upset at the real world because women don't choose to take on more physical or stressful jobs, and then says that the reason they don't take these jobs is because of men, Men are this men are that, men publicly grope women, every single one, and every woman is perfect no matter how obese or weird they are.

"10/10 amazing, a must see, not just a ""girly"" movie","I thought the movie was amazing. Full of nuances.It is an incredible movie that goes in a completely different direction then I thought it would. I loved how they didn't shy from the perception of Barbie. Also, it was very well cast, the characters were all fantastic. This isn't just a ""girls"" movie, either! I absolutely loved it. I wouldn't change a thing. I laughed, I cried, I was entertained the entire movie. The jokes were intelligent and a bit edgy. It may look like a silly action adventure, but textured dialog and rapid-fire gags add important layers of meaning. Great actors - great way of portraying silly messages and wonderful way of getting the important messages out as well. The movie had a great combination of humor and message.As someone else wrote in an editorial ""superficial yet smart, caustic yet clever, and showcasing not just the very best but even the worst of all things Barbie.

"A decent film, made more for adults than for kids","Well, here's the next movie I watched in preparation for the Oscars, and I can see why it got nominated in multiple categories. What a surprise...it sure wasn't what I was expecting!I'm going to preface this review by saying that I am a woman who had some Barbie dolls as a kid, but was never terribly fond of them (more of a horse and dinosaur girl, myself). So I wasn't really interested in this movie at first, until the Oscar nominations came along. But, I am glad I gave it a chance and saw it, as it was more meaningful and mature than I expected. It was not totally inappropriate for kids...but I didn't really get the sense it was a kids' film, despite being about a universe of toys.But, onto to the real review now...First off: The setting of Barbieland itself was well-done! It felt like those hot-pink plastic playsets had really come to life, and it was clever how the physics in that world imitated playtime (for instance, how there was no actual liquid in the cups Barbie drank out of).Next: the acting! Most of the cast did a pretty stellar job here. I thought Will Ferrell's role as the Mattel CEO was quirky and seemed a bit odd to me though, almost as if he was channeling too much energy from Buddy in ""Elf."" But the other characters did really hit home with the emotions they were trying to convey. The comedy was usually pretty spot-on too, and I did find myself laughing quite a lot throughout the film!Also, the music! ""I'm Just Ken"" was an unexpectedly fun jam with an 80s flair, ""What Was I Made For"" was certainly worthy of the attention it has gotten, and ""Dance the Night Away"" is also a pretty fun song, well-suited to a Barbie dance party.So, those things all worked well for me. Where the movie started to fall short was its plotlines and messaging.The basic premise was a fairly solid one...show stereotypical Barbie in her perfect dreamhouse world, but then explore what happens when the imperfections of the real world start to trickle in.The movie seemed kind of conflicted about how to build upon this idea, though. Barbie started to become ""imperfect"" because of America Ferrera's character playing with her, and transferring some of her own insecurities into the doll. But we never really ended up seeing that plotline developed as clearly as we could have. I would have liked to learn more about this character's backstory, as well as how her relationship with her daughter has become damaged.But, then we also discover that Kens are not satisfied with their role in Barbie life, and when they discover how prominent men are in the Real World, this inspires them to form a patriarchy and take over Barbieland. So now we have this plotline running along too, in addition to the underdeveloped one about the connection between a doll and the human playing with it.And on top of that, we have a plotline about the head honchos at Mattel trying to capture Barbie in the Real World and subdue her, returning her to her box (which would do...what, exactly? Would this restore her to the way she used to be?). But then they realize she has gone back to Barbieland with some humans, and they follow them there, only to skulk around and not really accomplish much at all besides some brief commentary near the end of the film.So I feel like the plot was quite a bit more scattered than it could have been. The messaging was also a little heavy-handed, as others have said. And, I wasn't completely satisfied with how things turned out for the Kens....Yeah, I am a woman, and women's rights are important, but this doesn't mean I want to see women rule the world and men put in the shadows. Both in the real world and in a child's playland, I want to see people of all genders be able to dream and to accomplish those dreams...to stand by each other's side rather than in anyone's shadow. The messages that Barbie doesn't have to be perfect to be her amazing self, and that Ken is not ""just Ken"" and has his own individual importance too, are great ones, but they get a little lost in the static of over-explanation here.All in all, I feel like this movie could have used some tweaking and streamlining to make its plot feel more complete and effective, but it was still a worthwhile experience, and better than I expected as someone who's never really been a Barbie fan.

You are Kenough,"For a movie that is so overhyped, ""Barbie"" by Greta Gerwig did not disappoint. I waited on purpose to watch this film, and I enjoyed it. There are also plenty of good, deep messages to be taken away from it from the exploration what means to be woman, consumerism and capitalism, and existentialism. It's also funny and hilarious. Margot Robbie IS Barbie. The Barbieland is perfectly done, with the pink and bright colors. I wish we saw more of that. The diverse versions of Barbies was done great, the entire doll world. It reflect great contract to the real world. I'm sure there were lot of easter eggs I missed I will try catch on my other watches. It does give us meaning that even in modern world, equality is to be still achieved, and that maybe, we are Kenough.",you kenough,for movi overhyp barbi greta gerwig disappoint i wait purpos watch film i enjoy there also plenti good deep messag taken away explor mean woman consumer capit existenti it also funni hilari margot robbi is barbi the barbieland perfectli done pink bright color i wish saw the diver version barbi done great entir doll world it reflect great contract real world im sure lot easter egg i miss i tri catch watch it give u mean even modern world equal still achiev mayb kenough
Is it really the movie of the summer?,"I have many opinions when it comes to this movie. The movie itself was great, but as everything in life nothing is perfect.Why a 7 out of 10? You may ask yourself, well even though the movie was great produced, had a great casting, great costumes and of course an impressive set, the plot was weak. The fact that Barbie (Margot Robbie) did not last even five minutes in the Real World disappointed me. I know that she was supposed to find Gloria (America Ferrera) to get ""fixed"", so she could go home and be the stereotypical barbie again, which in fact was the main plot of the movie, at first. However, she finds her real fast, not giving Barbie enough time to get to know the Real World, aside from the disrespectful male individuals in the beginning. I would have liked Barbie to experience the Real World in a different way, even though the Real World is messed up. I think it would have been nice for Barbie to eat an ice cream for the first time that was not made of plastic or simply for Ken to feel the water at the beach and realize it was not made of plastic or foam as well.Another thing that I did not like was that some characters from Barbie Dreamhouse were not in the movie, such as Ryan, Raquelle, and Nikki, but it was better like that because we all know Raquelle and her unexplainable need to be more successful than barbie at everything. Although at some points I wonder what would have been like if Raquelle were in the movie and totally interfered with Barbie's plan of getting fixed in the Real World.Let us talk about Ken (Ryan Gosling) for a minute. I must say that, at first, I found Ryan Gosling unfit for the Ken role, but I am completely happy with the way he portrayed his character. He made me laugh so much with his facial expressions and his speeches. I went to watch the movie for Barbie and ended up in love with Ken's character. However, Ken might have been funny, but when he totally invaded Barbie's house and threw her clothes away, I found it mean and disrespectful. Yet we have never thought about the Kens for a second, like where do they go when the Barbies go to sleep.I feel like they took this movie as a huge Mattel propaganda, instead of what it should have been. A fun movie where Barbie ventures into an unknow world for the first time trying to get her ""problems"" fixed but having to bear with Ken throughout the whole trip; like those comedy movies where a duo must stick together through a difficult situation even though they do not entirely love each other's personality.At last, I loved how Barbie did not need a man to be happy or complete and I also loved how Ken realized that he didn't need Barbie for him to be Kenough. Not like in Dreamhouse where Ken is always so clingy and needy of Barbie just because. Like Barbie don't need no man to be Barbie. I also loved Allan and his awkwardness, so sad that they discontinued him and Midge. I would have liked to see Ken and Allan as buddies, after all that's why Allan was created, to be Ken's buddy, although I don't think they would have clicked.Margot did an amazing job as Barbie and so did Ryan as Ken. I love them both and loved their acting in this as well, I truly enjoyed the movie expect the little things mentioned previously.",is realli movi summer,i mani opinion come movi the movi great everyth life noth perfectwhi you may ask well even though movi great produc great cast great costum cours impress set plot weak the fact barbi margot robbi last even five minut real world disappoint i know suppos find gloria america ferrera get fix could go home stereotyp barbi fact main plot movi first howev find real fast give barbi enough time get know real world asid disrespect male individu begin i would like barbi experi real world differ way even though real world mess i think would nice barbi eat ice cream first time made plastic simpli ken feel water beach realiz made plastic foam wellanoth thing i like charact barbi dreamhous movi ryan raquel nikki better like know raquel unexplain need success barbi everyth although point i wonder would like raquel movi total interf barbi plan get fix real worldlet u talk ken ryan gosl minut i must say first i found ryan gosl unfit ken role i complet happi way portray charact he made laugh much facial express speech i went watch movi barbi end love ken charact howev ken might funni total invad barbi hous threw cloth away i found mean disrespect yet never thought ken second like go barbi go sleepi feel like took movi huge mattel propaganda instead a fun movi barbi ventur unknow world first time tri get problem fix bear ken throughout whole trip like comedi movi duo must stick togeth difficult situat even though entir love other personalityat last i love barbi need man happi complet i also love ken realiz didnt need barbi kenough not like dreamhous ken alway clingi needi barbi like barbi dont need man barbi i also love allan awkward sad discontinu midg i would like see ken allan buddi that allan creat ken buddi although i dont think would clickedmargot amaz job barbi ryan ken i love love act well i truli enjoy movi expect littl thing mention previous
Loved it!,"This review is from a 45 year old woman...I had heard from friends the movie was better than expected, so we finally watched it. I laughed so hard at some scenes. It was very entertaining all the way through. I think every actor/actress was perfect for their roles. I loved Barbie's inner conflict and how it related to the real world. I especially loved the way they put a spotlight on how Barbie's world was the exact opposite of the real world (women rule vs men rule). I really loved Ken's story. It was very endearing to me. He just wanted to be seen. His crazy antics came from a place of hurt and a want for attention. I loved all of his scenes. I didn't think all the beer was necessary to make a point when it's a kid's movie though. (I mean I laughed at it and got the joke, but let's face it five year olds are watching this too.)My only criticism is that Barbie and Ken were made for each other. I think they could've each discovered themselves and still found a way back to each other. Even if they didn't do it in the movie they could've at least shown it would be a possibility. Ken could've chosen to go to the real world too.Overall, I loved it and about to watch it again (mainly for the laughs and the Ken song).",love,thi review year old womani heard friend movi better expect final watch i laugh hard scene it entertain way i think everi actoractress perfect role i love barbi inner conflict relat real world i especi love way put spotlight barbi world exact opposit real world woman rule v men rule i realli love ken stori it endear he want seen hi crazi antic came place hurt want attent i love scene i didnt think beer necessari make point kid movi though i mean i laugh got joke let face five year old watch toomi critic barbi ken made i think couldv discov still found way back even didnt movi couldv least shown would possibl ken couldv chosen go real world toooveral i love watch mainli laugh ken song

Wish i liked it more,"The hype and marketing drag me to this movie. I felt a little disappointed. Even though I did not had high expectations. It was not a bad movie. But it clearly isn't deserving that 7+ from me that it has now (in my opinion). The beginning is so strong but towards the end it's getting more disappointing. Great acting, great visuals/colors but sadly a very bad story. And yes the end is nicely done. But overall.. Not so great.

Cinematic Masterpiece,"The entire film I was thinking ""Literally me."" It is a perfect movie in every way, the choreography was absolutely stunning it was fantastic. This movie beats out Oppenheimer in every way possible, me and the boys pulled up to Barbie excited! Will Ferrell was pretty good too as well as all the actors. The Kens dancing as well as all the horses brought tears to my eyes. Also the best part I have to say is at the very end the Barbie song by Ice Spice it slapped I had to watch the credits just to listen to the song. 10/10 would recommend. This film was perfect in every way down to each and every frame.",cinemat masterpiec,the entir film i think liter it perfect movi everi way choreographi absolut stun fantast thi movi beat oppenheim everi way possibl boy pull barbi excit will ferrel pretti good well actor the ken danc well hors brought tear eye also best part i say end barbi song ice spice slap i watch credit listen song would recommend thi film perfect everi way everi frame
Absurd,"This movie has an absurdist quality about it that I can't really explain, almost like early 2000's Ben Stiller movies like Zoolander or Tropic Thunder, that makes you feel as if you hallucinated the whole thing. In that regard, another comparison is Monty Python's flying circus and the sort of delightful wittiness of the show.Barbie is profoundly silly and strange and an extremely high effort production, reflected in the spectacular set design. Ryan Gosling is absolutely perfect for the role so much that he steals the show. The result is that Barbie is almost completely unlike anything else you would see at the cinemas.I don' t think the film is perfect or anything, the ending, for me, felt a bit unsatisfying for Ken, at least, and the film also contains a car commercial, for some reason. At the end of the day, even if you disagree or have problems with the feminist argument that the film makes, the film will have you smiling like an idiot most of the time in a way that not many other pieces of media can.",absurd,thi movi absurdist qualiti i cant realli explain almost like earli ben stiller movi like zooland tropic thunder make feel hallucin whole thing in regard anoth comparison monti python fli circu sort delight witti showbarbi profoundli silli strang extrem high effort product reflect spectacular set design ryan gosl absolut perfect role much steal show the result barbi almost complet unlik anyth el would see cinemasi think film perfect anyth end felt bit unsatisfi ken least film also contain car commerci reason at end day even disagre problem feminist argument film make film smile like idiot time way mani piec medium
"Great acting, great set, great meaning, but rushed storyline","I loved the set design, acting and personal development of the characters, the nuance and meaning, but didn't like the rushed storyline. Production obviously invested a great deal in the set design, barbie dream houses, and wardrobes. It was pink everything with blue ""beach"", with a plastic vibe. It was cool how they incorporated the Barbie box and different outfits, something I loved as a child. I also thought TV Barbie was a blast from the past (90s baby here), and learned about other dolls like Midge, Skipper, and Alan. Also... they didn't do poor Midge any justice. She was played by a terrific actress, so there was definitely a storyline missed with her character. I thought Alan was played very well though.I thought that Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling played their characters perfectly, capturing their characters development and different nuances. You could definitely see Barbies transformation into a human, but Margot did a good job at keeping Barbie at her core even in human form.Some of my favorite storylines included the war of the Kens, the discovery of patriarchy, the brainwashing of the Barbies, and the takeover of the Barbies - again.However, the switch to the real world and back felt rushed, as well as the relationship development between Sasha and Gloria, and Barbie. Really what should have happened was a two part movie, to fully tell the story, or a 3 hour movie. I also felt they spent too much time in Barbie world in the beginning and felt myself getting bored.For example, Sasha and Gloria meet Barbie and after one scene believe that she is a doll and follow her back to Barbie world. I felt like Barbie should have had to work to make them believe her, making the discovery of Barbie world by Sasha and Gloria even sweeter, and Barbie's transformation into human even more complex. I wish I got to see her learn more about becoming human. I absolutely loved the gynecologist scene at the end, but felt that could have been earlier in the movie, with the scene with Ruth at the end.I couldn't discern if this movie was just a comedy or trying to be serious, with all the complex nuance surrounding feminism. It could have easily been both if there was more time spent on Barbie's transformation to human. Maybe a second movie could have been about her going back to Barbie world in human form to save her girls and restore the proper control to Barbie.",great act great set great mean rush storylin,i love set design act person develop charact nuanc mean didnt like rush storylin product obvious invest great deal set design barbi dream hous wardrob it pink everyth blue beach plastic vibe it cool incorpor barbi box differ outfit someth i love child i also thought tv barbi blast past babi learn doll like midg skipper alan also didnt poor midg justic she play terrif actress definit storylin miss charact i thought alan play well thoughi thought margot robbi ryan gosl play charact perfectli captur charact develop differ nuanc you could definit see barbi transform human margot good job keep barbi core even human formsom favorit storylin includ war ken discoveri patriarchi brainwash barbi takeov barbi againhowev switch real world back felt rush well relationship develop sasha gloria barbi realli happen two part movi fulli tell stori hour movi i also felt spent much time barbi world begin felt get boredfor exampl sasha gloria meet barbi one scene believ doll follow back barbi world i felt like barbi work make believ make discoveri barbi world sasha gloria even sweeter barbi transform human even complex i wish i got see learn becom human i absolut love gynecologist scene end felt could earlier movi scene ruth endi couldnt discern movi comedi tri seriou complex nuanc surround femin it could easili time spent barbi transform human mayb second movi could go back barbi world human form save girl restor proper control barbi
"First half excellent, second half clunkily on-the-nose","The first half is excellent, it starts with a 2001 Dawn of Man parody with Robbie as the original striped Barbie in place of the monolith, then shows us Barbieland. Barbie is overrun with morbid thoughts, so travels to the Real World with a stowaway Ken.At this point, it starts to lose its way - it gets bogged down in preaching against patriarchy - a word used so many times you could sip low-alcohol beer every time they say the word and be unconscious by the end.Characters give long monologues on how it's ""literally impossible to be a woman"", and the Barbies turn the Kens against each other bizarrely by using their sex appeal to evoke jealousy (is that really a feminist message?!).Whatever they were trying to say here, it doesn't come across well. It's preachy, on-the-nose, and too unbelievable to communicate a real message. Other films like Gone Girl with its Cool Girl monologue, or comedies like Bad Moms, make the point this movie seems to be trying to make much more effectively.Barbieland looks amazing, and the first sections there are fun (the whole patriarchy messaging was wisely cut out of the trailers). It would have been better to make this a Fool Triumphant story like Legally Blonde, where Stereotypical Barbie (as Robbie's Barbie is known) is seen as an airheaded bimbo in the real world yet proves herself.",first half excel second half clunkili onthenos,the first half excel start dawn man parodi robbi origin stripe barbi place monolith show u barbieland barbi overrun morbid thought travel real world stowaway kenat point start lose way get bog preach patriarchi word use mani time could sip lowalcohol beer everi time say word unconsci endcharact give long monologu liter imposs woman barbi turn ken bizarr use sex appeal evok jealousi realli feminist messagewhatev tri say doesnt come across well it preachi onthenos unbeliev commun real messag other film like gone girl cool girl monologu comedi like bad mom make point movi seem tri make much effectivelybarbieland look amaz first section fun whole patriarchi messag wise cut trailer it would better make fool triumphant stori like legal blond stereotyp barbi robbi barbi known seen airhead bimbo real world yet prove
A telling of modern day society through Barbie,"Who would have thought that a film about Barbie would be one of the most original, fresh film of recent years.There are so many positives of Barbie. First of all, the cast is brilliant. They work very well and are perfect for their roles, specifically Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (Oscar worthy in my opinion). A special mention to Michael Cera though for being spot on with his character.It's funny but also unexpectedly touching and really showcases the problems with modern day society in an inventive way.There was also surprises that were good and suited the narrative.Some criticisms are it's drags in certain scenes and it's definitely not for everyone but I guess that's cinema for you.Barbie is worth the watch!Edit: actually watched it for a second time and it's just a fun movie with really detailed set designs and cleverly thought out mannerisms.",a tell modern day societi barbi,who would thought film barbi would one origin fresh film recent yearsther mani posit barbi first cast brilliant they work well perfect role specif margot robbi ryan gosl oscar worthi opinion a special mention michael cera though spot characterit funni also unexpectedli touch realli showcas problem modern day societi invent wayther also surpris good suit narrativesom critic drag certain scene definit everyon i guess that cinema youbarbi worth watchedit actual watch second time fun movi realli detail set design cleverli thought manner

I feel like by the time I went to see the movie there were no surprises left.Watch the movie for the message but don't go in with super high expectations like I did.I believe that it's not worth it to watch in theatres.

It's rare to see something that synthesizes nostalgia, the societal journey of growing up (that extends generations) and balances this with comedy. There is a reason this debuted so highly at the box office and I am certain this will solidify itself as a cultural centerpiece for film schools in the future.

Funny and watchable,"The social commentary was pretty heavy-handed. Albeit, this is to be expected in the Barbie movie. However, it was genuinely funny. A lot of creativity and imagination went into this movie which ads to the charm. There were tons of little details that could make this a movie great to own and watch more than once. Plot was a cute but could have been smarter. Its nice to see a new movie that isn't just a remake or a sequel but I fully expect to see a franchise for this. I appreciated the few times that they seemingly poked fun at feminism.

So unexpected and so good.,"I came in with no expectations and no idea of the what movie was about... and I was blown away.

The balance between social commentary and comedy was excellent, however. While it occasionally came across heavy handed, that was very much the point and very intentional.

"Very nice, not joking","As a movie enthusiast and a long-time Barbie fan, I was intrigued to watch ""Barbie"". This film is not just a typical Barbie story - it's a cinematic masterpiece that beautifully blends fantasy and reality.The first thing that struck me was the film's technical excellence. The seamless transition between the vibrant Barbie Land and real-world scenes was done masterfully. It added depth to the narrative, elevating it from a kids' movie to a thought-provoking film.The highlight for me was the bold exploration of feminism. The film did not tiptoe around this topic, making it culturally relevant and significant. The blend of serious discussions with light-hearted humor was impressive, offering a fresh take on the classic Barbie tale.The characters were memorable and relatable. Barbie and Ken, in particular, were portrayed with a mix of exaggerated humor and genuine emotion. The film articulated a powerful message about self-identity and the struggle between maintaining perfection and dealing with life's complexities.However, there were aspects I found disappointing. The narrative moved away from Barbie Land too quickly, leaving me wanting more. Also, the film's constant self-reference to its cleverness felt overdone after a while.Despite these minor flaws, ""Barbie"" surpasses expectations. Its technical brilliance, feminist undertones, and the balance of humor and emotion make it a must-watch. It's a unique take on the Barbie world, and I highly recommend it.",veri nice joke,a movi enthusiast longtim barbi fan i intrigu watch barbi thi film typic barbi stori cinemat masterpiec beauti blend fantasi realityth first thing struck film technic excel the seamless transit vibrant barbi land realworld scene done master it ad depth narr elev kid movi thoughtprovok filmth highlight bold explor femin the film tipto around topic make cultur relev signific the blend seriou discus lightheart humor impress offer fresh take classic barbi taleth charact memor relat barbi ken particular portray mix exagger humor genuin emot the film articul power messag selfident struggl maintain perfect deal life complexitieshowev aspect i found disappoint the narr move away barbi land quickli leav want also film constant selfrefer clever felt overdon whiledespit minor flaw barbi surpass expect it technic brillianc feminist underton balanc humor emot make mustwatch it uniqu take barbi world i highli recommend
Barbie: A Missed Opportunity in Critiquing Consumer Culture,"""Barbie"" was a film that failed to resonate with me. I understand its premise, supposedly a critique of consumer culture, the frenzy of fashion, and the relentless pressure of pop culture. It aimed to depict the struggle to break free from this vicious cycle. However, the film's approach and narrative style didn't connect with me.I had expectations for a more impactful delivery, especially considering the profound implications of consumerism - how it not only confines us within a certain lifestyle but also poses a significant threat to our planet through industrial pressure, fashion industry demands, and the resulting pollution and waste. These are powerful themes, but unfortunately, the film did not explore them as effectively as I had hoped.The storytelling, the way the narrative unfolded, and the overall execution seemed to miss the mark, failing to leverage cinema as a powerful medium to convey these critical messages. While there might be an underlying intention to address these issues, the film doesn't succeed in making that clear or impactful. In summary, ""Barbie"" felt like a missed opportunity to delve deeply into the dangers of consumerism and its global ramifications.",barbi a miss opportun critiqu consum cultur,barbi film fail reson i understand premis supposedli critiqu consum cultur frenzi fashion relentless pressur pop cultur it aim depict struggl break free viciou cycl howev film approach narr style didnt connect mei expect impact deliveri especi consid profound implic consumer confin u within certain lifestyl also pose signific threat planet industri pressur fashion industri demand result pollut wast these power theme unfortun film explor effect i hopedth storytel way narr unfold overal execut seem miss mark fail leverag cinema power medium convey critic messag while might underli intent address issu film doesnt succeed make clear impact in summari barbi felt like miss opportun delv deepli danger consumer global ramif
Barbie Review,"Greta Gerwig is a very intelligent filmmaker and she has followed up her sumptuous rendition of Little Women (2019) with a film that could not be more different stylistically, demonstrating an astonishing versatility. Its feminist takedown of the Patriarchy is heavy-handed in its messaging but in just the right kind of whip smart way. The set design is incredible, transporting you into the pink sugar rush world of Barbie then into the pink sugar rush world of Los Angeles and back again.Margot Robbie is a powerhouse talent and Ryan Gosling is dumb as a block of wood as Ken (I mean, what's he really for?). His fragile masculinity threatened by what he sees of the role of men in Real World he attempts a coup in Barbie World but is overcome by the resistance of the Barbies assisted by Real World's Gloria (America Ferrera). The character of Gloria is the real heart of the film as she represents every woman trying to negotiate the 'can't win' dynamics of a world in which beauty is said to be only skin deep but the male gaze controls everything.The inside jokes about some of the lesser known Barbie iterations are hilarious. Funniest of all is the fact that toy company Mattel is being viciously taken down all the way through a film they hope will re-enliven their brand. Barbie's dawning awareness that she does not represent the liberating force claimed for her is a clever observation and a subversive dig at Mattel's corporate culture.

Fun but disappointing,"Funny thing to say about a Barbie movie, means I had my hopes too up, but it's more about who directed it, I think she's pretty good.What worked for me was the barbie world, and Margot and especially Ryan were great. Every scene with Ryan was great, he's got great comedic timing.What didn't work was the real world. The real people are supposed to come and teach the dolls what real life is like, but they do it with the most cliche, cringiest dialogue (I would call it womansplaining honestly, stuff that will make everyone cringe in like 10 years - but hey, it's a Barbie movie in 2023, what can you expect).The issue really is that the real people (the mother and daughter and the Mattel people and even people on the streets) were just not believable as real people. So if you're not going to show believable characters, you may as well just show me the dolls and remove the real world all together.Overall pretty funny, worth a watch, but it has much less depth than I imagined from the trailers. In the end it's just a huge product placement, when it could've been more.

Ken represents manhood without capitalism or without a genital... blah blah blah...This movie should not have been a political satire. It should have been a fantasy romance comedy musical such as Entangled or Disney movies. I left the movie theater after its first 30 minutes so if this one didn't turn out to be a masterpiece in the remaining 1:30 hour of its runtime I had much more funtime wandering under hot sun than watching Barbie...Robbie and Gosling are as good as they could get with this absurd writing and directing.My rating is 3/10 only for the sake of its starting level production staff, PA, Gathering servants who worked for minumum union wage.",no way thi is a good movi,barbi repres opress woman around world rule men ken repres manhood without capit without genit blah blah blahthi movi polit satir it fantasi romanc comedi music entangl disney movi i left movi theater first minut one didnt turn masterpiec remain hour runtim i much funtim wander hot sun watch barbierobbi gosl good could get absurd write directingmi rate sake start level product staff pa gather servant work minumum union wage
Pretty Pink,"Barbie is a beautifully heart-warming extravaganza for both boys and girls alike. A gloriously pink, joy-filled experience that I can't wait to go and see again. From the wonderful set design and perfect casting to the brilliant soundtrack and story to match, there is something for everyone to enjoy.I can't pay more respect to the cast, Margot Robbie as stereotypical Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken are the obvious standouts, they certainly delivered on the hype - but I was pleasantly surprised by Will Ferrell's short but hilarious moments on screen as well as Michael Cera as Alan (a true unsung hero).As mentioned, the set design is really quite stunning. Gazing upon Barbie land in all it's pink glory is pure joy, there is no doubt the set design is one of the films greatest strengths. But Barbie doesn't just look great, it sounds great with its vibrant collection of tracks and performances (including Ryan Gosling and his guitar).Barbie wraps up all the fun and colour with a solid story and strong positive message that fits perfectly in the world Greta Gerwig created. Of course some people may not enjoy the social commentary that pervades Barbie but I believe Greta Gerwig laid out the foundations for such a message perfectly, empowering girls and boys of all ages.Barbie feels like a must see movie, it built the hype and then delivered exceptionally. If you haven't been tempted yet you're missing out on all the fun that this beautiful movie has to offer.",pretti pink,barbi beauti heartwarm extravaganza boy girl alik a glorious pink joyfil experi i cant wait go see from wonder set design perfect cast brilliant soundtrack stori match someth everyon enjoyi cant pay respect cast margot robbi stereotyp barbi ryan gosl ken obviou standout certainli deliv hype i pleasantli surpris will ferrel short hilari moment screen well michael cera alan true unsung heroa mention set design realli quit stun gaze upon barbi land pink glori pure joy doubt set design one film greatest strength but barbi doesnt look great sound great vibrant collect track perform includ ryan gosl guitarbarbi wrap fun colour solid stori strong posit messag fit perfectli world greta gerwig creat of cours peopl may enjoy social commentari pervad barbi i believ greta gerwig laid foundat messag perfectli empow girl boy agesbarbi feel like must see movi built hype deliv except if havent tempt yet your miss fun beauti movi offer
A magical journey with a confusing ending,"Barbie is a film that stands out in many aspects, from its comedic moments to its unique charm. The world it presents is filled with vibrant colors, whimsical settings, lively music, and a sense of fantasy and extravagance. Visually speaking, the film is truly unmatched. The actors delivered commendable performances, with special applause going to Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. However, I must admit that I personally enjoyed the scenes included in the trailer more than some of the other parts of the film. They struck me as particularly funny.Where the story loses points is in its confusing message. While the film clearly aims to promote gender equality, the way it delivers this message suggests a certain superiority of the female gender. Some of the dialogue felt forced and unrealistic within the narrative. It wasn't so much the fact that the pep talks were about women, but rather the way they were integrated into the story. I want to clarify that my criticisms are not driven by bigotry or sexism. As a woman myself, I appreciate the intention but felt it could have been handled more subtly.I found it disappointing that many of the characters in the film, such as Alan and several of the Barbies/Kens, lacked relevance and development or were straight up stereotypes. Additionally, I would have liked to see more exploration of Barbie Land and its unique characteristics. On a positive note, the message about the transient nature of one's life in comparison to the enduring power of an idea was sweet and exciting.",a magic journey confus end,barbi film stand mani aspect comed moment uniqu charm the world present fill vibrant color whimsic set live music sen fantasi extravag visual speak film truli unmatch the actor deliv commend perform special applaus go margot robbi ryan gosl howev i must admit i person enjoy scene includ trailer part film they struck particularli funnywher stori lose point confus messag while film clearli aim promot gender equal way deliv messag suggest certain superior femal gender some dialogu felt forc unrealist within narr it wasnt much fact pep talk woman rather way integr stori i want clarifi critic driven bigotri sexism a woman i appreci intent felt could handl subtlyi found disappoint mani charact film alan sever barbiesken lack relev develop straight stereotyp addit i would like see explor barbi land uniqu characterist on posit note messag transient natur one life comparison endur power idea sweet excit
Come on Barbie,"Based on the decade old toys Barbie from Mattel, Barbie was released in summer 2023 and became one of the highlights beside Oppenheimer. This time Barbie ends in the real world California, as Will Ferrel plays the leader of the pack. I am no Barbie expert, but the acting is so good that they look like humans playing dolls. This movie are not just for Barbie die hard fans, but also Bronies, adults who grew up in the 1960s and the teens too. The visual effects are nice that ranks from the travel montage with the Dutch backgrounds to the California beach settings.

Unexpected but so enjoyable,"This plot of Barbie unexpected, I watched it with no real expectations and no other knowledge about what it would be like. Barbie took me by surprise at it had a super deep and meaningful plot on being a woman, what the barbie life is like vs what it actually is like to be a woman. Plus the ken parts were super hilarious, the whole cinema was falling out of our seats at Ryan Gosling, he played Ken so well. And it was great to have these funny moments through out, when some of the parts were more serious. But I wish it had more barbie references, maybe from the movies which is such a memory for me growing up, but it seemed to focus more on Barbies with jobs trying to show that Girls can grow up to do anything, but I guess they couldn't cater to everything as it might've been to hard to squeeze it all it.But other than that this movie was enjoyable, maybe not one of my favourites and I might not watch it again, but seeing it in the cinema was such a great atmosphere and it was fun to see everyone dress up and have fun and laugh together! <3.",unexpect enjoy,thi plot barbi unexpect i watch real expect knowledg would like barbi took surpris super deep meaning plot woman barbi life like v actual like woman plu ken part super hilari whole cinema fall seat ryan gosl play ken well and great funni moment part seriou but i wish barbi refer mayb movi memori grow seem focu barbi job tri show girl grow anyth i guess couldnt cater everyth mightv hard squeez itbut movi enjoy mayb one favourit i might watch see cinema great atmospher fun see everyon dress fun laugh togeth
A HONEST REVIEW,People who followed all the lawsuits and all the Barbies throughout the years. It broke every single Hollywood Law in the books. Mattel made Satire out of their own overprotection of the Barbie Product. Margot Robbie was a breath of fresh air when she produced and starred in Barbie. This is one movie for both males and females and those who absolutely HATE Barbie. It is pure comedy and will never stop laughing throughout the whole movie.Know your Barbie History before coming to the movie.

Sublime,"I'm only writing this due to the misperception of this movie. I saw the movie opening night with my GF who loved and still loves Barbie. She is stereotypical Barbie and she dressed up in pink and had a wonderful time. If you're a fan of Barbie you can stop reading here and just go see the movie you will love it.In fact if you are a fan of Barbie I suggest you stop reading this review and allow yourself to enjoy the fantasy and childhood nostalgia the movie will surely provide and avoid discussing the movie with anyone who wants to dissect it or take away from your feel good experience.However, for the people who are championing the movie as a feminist masterpiece or hating on it for its depiction of men, I would like to ask if you watched the same movie? Neither men nor women were the target in this movie. This movie was taking shots at beautiful and desirable people in general. It is established quite early on that the Barbie's and Kens live in a dreamland and falsely believe they have solved the worlds problems and live in blissful ignorance. As soon as this main charachters bliss is threatened, that becomes the problem that the movie focuses on needing to be solved. Even though many real world problems are addressed and pointed out (usually by people not good looking enough to live in barbieland), they are all ignored and left unresolved by the end of the movie, that is, aside from the inclusion of ""ordinary people"" by Mattels introduction of ""Ordinary Barbie"", which seems to serve as further evidence of Mattel claiming self awareness (hammered home by constant self deprecation while never actually crossing the line into actually being the antagonist of the film) and wanting to distance itself from their objectification of women by making Barbie in the first place. Finally Barbie did not get any character growth by becoming real, Mattel just placed her in a box and got her off the production line through manipulative means employed by the founder of Mattel - an old woman. (honestly ladies, this is your real enemy in life lol. Men are pretty useless as depicted, old women who hate you for being young and shitty men who cant have you are the ones who oppress you)The movie however seemed to say these things through mockery:
1- if you treat men like the Barbies treat the Kens, you will become one option of many, as made clear by being labelled low commitment casual girlfriends.2 - When your old (like Barbie) you have to leave barbyland and you will be immediately devalued by having to relinquish access to your vagina. HOWEVER even though Ken is old (and unbelievably dumb and useless) he still gets to live in Barby Dreamland and maintains access to all the young beautiful Barby's which just seems to reinforce the supposedly ""patriarchal"" concept of men maintaining value as partners far longer then women.3 - If you're young and pretty (for women) or just pretty (for men), you dont have any real problems and get to focus solely on easing any perceived blows to your extremely fragile emotional state while all the ugly people in the real world maintain order and functionality while dealing with ""real problems"".4 - There in fact is a special existence for people who are good looking enough to qualify and even though its not based in reality, as long as your good enough, you get to live in the perfect dreamland while ugly people live in reality.That being said, the movie is done very well and fun to watch and the casting is done well with all criticisms of the cast being too old, being proven wrong as their age was the actual focal point of the movie. Aside from America Ferrara. We do not like her as an audience lol. Superstore proved this. Her patronizing speech is an insult to women's intellects and the low point of the movie. Gosling's accidently but surprisingly meta self portrayal is probably the highlight. (I dont understand why men are upset by this, how Gosling was portrayed in this movie is exactly how I have seen him my entire life lol..).I'd rate Barby as Sublime.",sublim,im write due mispercept movi i saw movi open night gf love still love barbi she stereotyp barbi dress pink wonder time if your fan barbi stop read go see movi love itin fact fan barbi i suggest stop read review allow enjoy fantasi childhood nostalgia movi sure provid avoid discus movi anyon want dissect take away feel good experiencehowev peopl champion movi feminist masterpiec hate depict men i would like ask watch movi neither men woman target movi thi movi take shot beauti desir peopl gener it establish quit earli barbi ken live dreamland fals believ solv world problem live bliss ignor a soon main characht bliss threaten becom problem movi focus need solv even though mani real world problem address point usual peopl good look enough live barbieland ignor left unresolv end movi asid inclus ordinari peopl mattel introduct ordinari barbi seem serv evid mattel claim self awar hammer home constant self deprec never actual cross line actual antagonist film want distanc objectif woman make barbi first place final barbi get charact growth becom real mattel place box got product line manipul mean employ founder mattel old woman honestli ladi real enemi life lol men pretti useless depict old woman hate young shitti men cant one oppress youth movi howev seem say thing mockeri treat men like barbi treat ken becom one option mani made clear label low commit casual girlfriend when old like barbi leav barbyland immedi devalu relinquish access vagina howev even though ken old unbeliev dumb useless still get live barbi dreamland maintain access young beauti barbi seem reinforc supposedli patriarch concept men maintain valu partner far longer woman if your young pretti woman pretti men dont real problem get focu sole ea perceiv blow extrem fragil emot state ugli peopl real world maintain order function deal real problem there fact special exist peopl good look enough qualifi even though base realiti long good enough get live perfect dreamland ugli peopl live realitythat said movi done well fun watch cast done well critic cast old proven wrong age actual focal point movi asid america ferrara we like audienc lol superstor prove her patron speech insult woman intellect low point movi gosl accid surprisingli meta self portray probabl highlight i dont understand men upset gosl portray movi exactli i seen entir life lolid rate barbi sublim
Hollow as it could be,"I don't know who is the audience of this film. Characters are boring to watch. The plot and writing are really low quality. Choreography is undergrad 1st year students project level.No development of character whatsoever. From 5th minute Margot Robbie is a sad-smile-crybaby, while all through the movie Ken is a masculine Miami-stereotype man.Pseudo philosophy is cheap. Montage is glued together from parts what was filmed in different places and times into a single scenes and it HURTS MY EYES. This movie has too much easter eggs for a young audience, it's too dumb and caricature for an adult movie.What really makes it bad is director work. So much things would be stunning if, for example Wes Anderson worked with the scene and cameras, whilst the movie is somewhere on the level of She-Hulk by the quality of montage.It was a waste of time and I do not blame the actors for that: it was failed by plots, dialogues and writing.",hollow could,i dont know audienc film charact bore watch the plot write realli low qualiti choreographi undergrad st year student project levelno develop charact whatsoev from th minut margot robbi sadsmilecrybabi movi ken masculin miamistereotyp manpseudo philosophi cheap montag glu togeth part film differ place time singl scene hurt my eye thi movi much easter egg young audienc dumb caricatur adult moviewhat realli make bad director work so much thing would stun exampl we anderson work scene camera whilst movi somewher level shehulk qualiti montageit wast time i blame actor fail plot dialogu write
Beautiful film,"I'm only writing this review because I saw this film go from a 7.6 to a 6.9 within a couple of weeks. This film reflects woman hood. It is a cinematic masterpiece made to show how the world works for women and how damaging the patriarchy is for men and for women. The songs are masterpieces, the production design is incredible and the overall story is unique. How did greta not get nominated for this film is beyond me. It is a turning point for women in film.

I was skeptical but was pleasantly proved wrong,"Opposite of my expectations, overall I thought this movie was entertaining and pretty funny. Ryan Gosling was fantastic as Ken and the Ken's as a whole were really funny and my favorite part about the movie. The set design was knocked out of the park, it was the perfect look of Barbie land and it really immersed you in it. Lastly I thought the little details in the movie were awesome, like as if somebody was playing with Barbie like when she floats down from her house, the shower water is imaginary, and the drink she has at breakfast is imaginary. I love little details like that and Gerwig killed it with those.But just like everyone has been talking about, I'd like to talk about the ""message"" this movie is pushing. I overall didn't feel like they were straight ""man hating"", but there definitely were certain parts where you just roll your eyes but it didn't take away from the overall experience for me. The part where they go to the real world and every dude they encounter is a cat calling misogynistic a-hole was a bit much for me, I am obviously aware it happens in the real world but they exaggerated it quite a bit. Imagine you take your young daughter to see this, it's gonna make her think every dude she encounters going forward is an a hole growing up.The Characters of America Ferrera's daughter and the Mattel higher up's were absolutely worthless to the plot. I mean she is introduced to us by honestly being a b**** to Barbie spewing adult themed nonsense and then after that really has no growth and just is along for the ""diversion/twist"" that her mom is the one that needed Barbie's help.My main gripe with this movie is the plot of the last 30 minutes and the ending. Ken comes back from Earth with ""Patriarchal"" ideals and takes over Barbie land and I honestly couldn't tell if they were supposed to be the so on ""villains"" of the movie or if just it was a joking way to have a problem in the movie. Because I never really felt like they were bad guys, Ken was treated like crap by Barbie and so it makes it really hard to ever root against him. The end was just real clunky and stuff just happened so fast and got too serious too fast. It's like they did it just they could get a way to fit in that montage video to pull women's emotional strings.PSA: This is not a kids movie, definitely intended for young adults to middle aged women. Most of the humor in it is adult level humor.But overall I came into this movie thinking I would dread it but came out happy with my experience watching it.",i skeptic pleasantli prove wrong,opposit expect overal i thought movi entertain pretti funni ryan gosl fantast ken ken whole realli funni favorit part movi the set design knock park perfect look barbi land realli immers lastli i thought littl detail movi awesom like somebodi play barbi like float hous shower water imaginari drink breakfast imaginari i love littl detail like gerwig kill thosebut like everyon talk id like talk messag movi push i overal didnt feel like straight man hate definit certain part roll eye didnt take away overal experi the part go real world everi dude encount cat call misogynist ahol bit much i obvious awar happen real world exagger quit bit imagin take young daughter see gon na make think everi dude encount go forward hole grow upth charact america ferrera daughter mattel higher up absolut worthless plot i mean introduc u honestli b barbi spew adult theme nonsens realli growth along diversiontwist mom one need barbi helpmi main gripe movi plot last minut end ken come back earth patriarch ideal take barbi land i honestli couldnt tell suppos villain movi joke way problem movi becaus i never realli felt like bad guy ken treat like crap barbi make realli hard ever root the end real clunki stuff happen fast got seriou fast it like could get way fit montag video pull woman emot stringspsa thi kid movi definit intend young adult middl age woman most humor adult level humorbut overal i came movi think i would dread came happi experi watch
"An comment about feminism, men & gender equality","An film that tries to balance out humor and leaving social criticism in the minds of the viewers. Barbie falls flat with its criticism not only because it feels flat and out of place, but most importantly unnatural and unimportant.Why does a film about a female toy that kids play with need to comment on feminism. The use of feminism is to give a woman the right to choose for themselves and to be what they want, for example no woman nowadays should be a housewife if they do not want it to be. There are still current problems such as loans, the pay gap shouldn't be a thing, that is where gender equality is important, but Barbie gets it wrong and simply criticizes the mental state of being a woman and having it hard in its own life and still try to cover it up and being controlled by men. While I know that this is a problem in some cultures and countries, it is not the ones that people watch this film in. And Barbie definitely doesn't means it in that way.Ken plays the stereotypical men, he wants to rule and fulfill himself in his life, and he searches for meaning. His character development ends with him needing to let go of Barbie to truly find himself, and Barbie says that he wasn't created only to be Barbie's boyfriend, but truly, he was. No one bought a ken toy without a Barbie toy, so why can't we let the toys that girls play with, be toys they play with?Barbie sees the Real world as an issue because she thinks it only gets controlled by men, but she doesn't see that barbie land is a place which has a woman dictatorship.I was prepared for an fun time with laughs, but was rather left devastated by this film, because it tries to criticize how we treat feminism and gender equality, but then it gets it wrong, and finds problems where they is none. It rather comes across as the message, woman are good, men are bad.

An unexpected surprise,"I truly hate living in the year of our lord 2023 because my first thought getting out of the theater tonight ended up being: ""THIS is what all the loser right-wing grifters were losing their minds over?"" But I also like living in this time because we get to experience bold, creative films like Greta Gerwig's Barbie.I wasn't really sure what to expect here, but I love everything Greta Gerwig so I hoped to enjoy myself, and I definitely did. I loved the costume designs, all the bright colors, and the random animated bits like smoke coming from the car and the sequences of traveling to-and-from Barbieland.Not all the humor worked for me, but I had some pretty big laughs when it did hit. Can we talk about how hilarious it is that the worst imaginable scenario is being subjected to a serenade of a Matchbox 20 song? Speaking of music, now I have no idea what my favorite original film song this year is, I'm Just Ken or Peaches!Some of the messaging can be a little on the nose but it's still something that more people could do good to hear a little more about.

The real crime is the requirement of a full-time dual income household,"It has great moments. The beginning might be the strongest I've ever seen. Unique. The soundtrack has a few songs that fall flat but overall it was very strong. Cinematography was unreal. Calling the old woman beautiful was rare and cool. The writing does seem to break down eventually though like really dropping the ball articulating the themes at times. Its not ""dark, weird, and crazy"" to have thoughts about death. That was just a strange choice. Margot Robbie had the best performance by far.I really think the movie aims for a message of equality so its kinda contradictory that the resolution in barbieland is a woman-run government. I get what they're doing. I get its not a real place. But then why make a joke about letting the men have a few seats in the lower courts, when four women sit on the supreme court today. Joke about them just not being able to be president or something if you want it to hit home.I think when people call this movie ""preachy"" theyre mostly talking about America Ferrera's speech. A lot of the points are valid but idk about:""And it turns out in fact that not only are you doing
everything wrong, but also everything is your fault.""""never fall down, never fail, never show fear""Maybe in finance bro world? I still think the movie is well-intentioned.

Acting is Perfect,"If you're making brand films, each of his directors reveals his own vision, and that vision generally lacks some points. However, I think Greta Gerwig knew all aspects of Barbie so well that she reflected it on the screen perfectly. Margot Robbie also played the part very well apart from a few small scenes. In fact, when Barbie is mentioned, the role is well-accepted. Of course, Barbie is not the only character fully reflected in the movie. By writing Ken as a one-dimensional character and inserting a prominent role in the story, he significantly increased the directors of the movie games. Ryan Gosling had a great acting. Frankly, he manages to steal the heart of television in every scene on the screen. For the other Barbie and Ken players, the states didn't show much of a performance (Maybe Kate McKinnon). There were no such important scenes anyway. But America Ferrera didn't do a great job despite having a very available house. I wouldn't say that I played badly, but there are a lot of actors who give better use of that role in my opinion.",act perfect,if your make brand film director reveal vision vision gener lack point howev i think greta gerwig knew aspect barbi well reflect screen perfectli margot robbi also play part well apart small scene in fact barbi mention role wellaccept of cours barbi charact fulli reflect movi by write ken onedimension charact insert promin role stori significantli increas director movi game ryan gosl great act frankli manag steal heart televis everi scene screen for barbi ken player state didnt show much perform mayb kate mckinnon there import scene anyway but america ferrera didnt great job despit avail hous i wouldnt say i play badli lot actor give better use role opinion
Much Deeper Than I Thought,"Going into the movie, i went in mostly blind and didn't expect much into the way it explored a deeper and more abstract plotline. Cast was star-studded and everything seemed to be in place, nothing off there. However, to me, the movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a more serious movie with a straight plotline or being goofy with a more abstract plotline. I think the humor was well-executed, but the movie leaned too much into both sides. By doing that, the potential in the movie if they had picked and focused on one solely was diminished. Excellent individual performances from ferrell, gosling, and greenblatt.",much deeper than i thought,go movi went mostli blind didnt expect much way explor deeper abstract plotlin cast starstud everyth seem place noth howev movi couldnt decid whether want seriou movi straight plotlin goofi abstract plotlin i think humor wellexecut movi lean much side by potenti movi pick focus one sole diminish excel individu perform ferrel gosl greenblatt
For the whole family,"Laugh out loud humor, fantastic sets and costumes that contain a wonderful message. I took my teenage daughter and preteen son and we all were incredibly surprised by exactly how much we enjoyed the entire film. I was not sure what to expect but it exceeded anything I could have imagined. While there was an inherently difficult topic at the core, it was handled delicately and with care. Lots of hilarity for the adults but minimal issues that would create discomfort if you take younger kids. My kids have already said they want to watch it again.

Disappointing,"I would probably feel more positive about the film if it hadn't been hyped up so much in the marketing and press junkets.The first half of the film is essentially the trailer and the second half doesn't deliver anything profound. I was disappointed the conversation on femininity and what it means to be a woman didn't develop past what is already in pop culture. Yes we know there are high standards for beauty.The second half of the film becomes a mess, with the meaning that they'd set up in the first part of the film falling apart. The scene dedicated to breaking up with Ken was plain confusing to me, the part where she becomes a human even more so and then the gynaecologist appointment ugh. I probably needed to have a very different sense of humour to watch this film (despite the fact I find Ryan Gosling hilarious in other things)I got the to the end thinking ""is that it?""",disappoint,i would probabl feel posit film hadnt hype much market press junketsth first half film essenti trailer second half doesnt deliv anyth profound i disappoint convers feminin mean woman didnt develop past alreadi pop cultur ye know high standard beautyth second half film becom mess mean theyd set first part film fall apart the scene dedic break ken plain confus part becom human even gynaecologist appoint ugh i probabl need differ sen humour watch film despit fact i find ryan gosl hilari thingsi got end think
Bizarrely entertaining,"This was definitely an entertaining movie but it went in so many different directions at times. Also, the product placement and clear control from Mattel takes you out of the fantasy at times. Honestly, it is unique and not something really done before, so it gets points for that.

Not for me.,"I was thinking that Barbie was going to be a light hearted family movie.....it is not. You don't want to take the kids to this movie. I mean that was probably obvious from the trailer, casting and vibe. But if you were looking for a fun movie to take you away from the everyday heaviness...this is not that movie. If you want eye candy and lots of posturing and narrative sequences, then this movie is for you....otherwise I'd say don't go. Greta Gerwigs third directorial outing could have been so much more....sadly it does not live up to the hype. I just don't understand why they can't seem to make enjoyable movies that transport you away anymore.",not,i think barbi go light heart famili movieit you dont want take kid movi i mean probabl obviou trailer cast vibe but look fun movi take away everyday heavinessthi movi if want eye candi lot postur narr sequenc movi youotherwis id say dont go greta gerwig third directori outing could much moresadli live hype i dont understand cant seem make enjoy movi transport away anymor
10/10,"This film was a lot deeper than I had anticipated. I wasn't into Barbie's but I had to see what all the fuss was about. It's a really good film if you understand the logic/message behind it. I won't waste my time explaining it as you either get it or you completely miss the point.Although its message was clear as day I've read things online that show the maturity levels of some individuals who are honestly the examples that prove this point completely.It's a great film if you are a deep person who likes asking deeper questions, give it a chance.I think the cast was great, the film was great, and honestly, the message made the movie deep and worth it. 10/10.",,thi film lot deeper i anticip i wasnt barbi i see fuss it realli good film understand logicmessag behind i wont wast time explain either get complet miss pointalthough messag clear day ive read thing onlin show matur level individu honestli exampl prove point completelyit great film deep person like ask deeper question give chancei think cast great film great honestli messag made movi deep worth
Fun! (not necessarily a compliment),"Barbie is Gerwig-Lite: just far too self-aware for its own good, to the point where it feels like it was written explicitly to impress critics. Gerwig and Baumbach parrot out every single intersectional feminist talking point in the book in an effort to communicate to the audience, ""Hey, we're aware of the philosophical complexities of this issue but we're still having fun!"" Which, fine, but Gerwig has already probed the question of what it means to be a woman much more meaningfully in her previous films without the kind of extratextual baggage this resorts to; political astuteness doesn't make for very entertaining or memorable film dialogue.Also, I long for the (often hinted-at) version of this movie that critiques the toxicity and shortcomings of corporate feminism instead of basically endorsing it wholeheartedly (although I guess the ending sort of posits it as ""not for everyone"" but again, you see my point as to how overwritten this is). The production design and costumes are colorful and intricate but feel too safe, the soundtrack is rife with bland focus-group pop, and the whole thing has that weird plasticky look and feel to it that all Hollywood movies post-COVID seem to have. (I suppose ""plastic"" is appropriate for a movie about America's favorite doll, but I watched some of The Thin Red Line after getting home from the theater and felt myself ache for a time when humans were able to make beautiful-looking movies). It's indeed as fun and cute and peppy as everyone's said it is, but it could have been so much more.Major points deducted for uncalled-for digs at Pavement and The Godfather (plenty of women love both!!)",fun necessarili compliment,barbi gerwiglit far selfawar good point feel like written explicitli impress critic gerwig baumbach parrot everi singl intersect feminist talk point book effort commun audienc hey awar philosoph complex issu still fun which fine gerwig alreadi probe question mean woman much meaning previou film without kind extratextu baggag resort polit astut doesnt make entertain memor film dialoguealso i long often hintedat version movi critiqu toxic shortcom corpor femin instead basic endors wholeheartedli although i guess end sort posit everyon see point overwritten the product design costum color intric feel safe soundtrack rife bland focusgroup pop whole thing weird plasticki look feel hollywood movi postcovid seem i suppos plastic appropri movi america favorit doll i watch the thin red line get home theater felt ach time human abl make beautifullook movi it inde fun cute peppi everyon said could much moremajor point deduct uncalledfor dig pavement the godfath plenti woman love
"Enjoy the movie, feminists!","Barbie is the problem with modern Hollywood. I'm not a sexist, but this movie shows how all men are trash. The ending drags so long, just tell ""the message"". There are some gags that landed and the whole theater, packed with girls, laughed, but there were some, where the theatre was quite and i could hear only the fart of the woman sitting next to me. If the main villian Will Farrel, wasn't there, the movie is gonna be a little better, because the villians do nothing and only drag the pace of the movie. Greta Gerwig for the most part, did a pretty good job and the casting is perfect. Ryan Gosling is born for this role and Margot Robbie is great, as i expected. Overall, the movie is not for me. The little girls will deffinely like a lot more, than i did.",enjoy movi feminist,barbi problem modern hollywood im sexist movi show men trash the end drag long tell messag there gag land whole theater pack girl laugh theatr quit could hear fart woman sit next if main villian will farrel wasnt movi gon na littl better villian noth drag pace movi greta gerwig part pretti good job cast perfect ryan gosl born role margot robbi great expect overal movi the littl girl deffin like lot
Probably the greatest movie of all time,This movie is excellent. Funny & brilliant throughout.Margot Robbie is sensational. Ryan Gosling is excellent. The script is superb. The visuals are incredible. The outfits are spectacular. The music is fabulous. The dance scenes are fun! All the details from the pink slide through to the nods to all the retired Barbie friends are so wondrous & nostalgic. It's truly truly a brilliant movie.A week after seeing it I'm still thinking about it.When was the last time people dressed up to see a film?!It's a truly remarkable movie.

"Funny, but wish things played out different","The movie started out fun and strong. I agree with some of the other reviews on here that the cast was excellent, set design superb, etc. However, the plot needed more clarity and to choose a better direction.What I liked: It emphasized how with Barbie/dolls girls get to imagine themselves becoming all the things they can imagine and in their worlds they can control everything. Unfortunately, in the real world, patriarchy exists and we're limited. I liked it didn't marry Barbie off to Ken or make her have to have a relationship to be happy.What I didn't like: The stereotypical treatment of men and the relegation of them back to second class citizens in Barbie land. That things got confusing and hard to follow. Why exactly were all Barbies instantly brainwashed but stereotypical Barbie?I wish they could have handled the gender issues in a way to enforce more equality between the Kens and the Barbies without necessarily marrying them all of in pairs. Maybe Ken finally does get his mojo dojo saloon just not by taking over Barbies dream house. He gets acknowledged and gets his space too. Maybe he hooks up with Midge because he moves on. Maybe he gets a beach house so he can Beach off whenever he wants. I don't know. It was funny. I laughed out loud several times. Glad I saw it. Just wish they went some different directions.",funni wish thing play differ,the movi start fun strong i agre review cast excel set design superb etc howev plot need clariti choos better directionwhat i like it emphas barbiedol girl get imagin becom thing imagin world control everyth unfortun real world patriarchi exist limit i like didnt marri barbi ken make relationship happywhat i didnt like the stereotyp treatment men releg back second class citizen barbi land that thing got confus hard follow whi exactli barbi instantli brainwash stereotyp barbiei wish could handl gender issu way enforc equal ken barbi without necessarili marri pair mayb ken final get mojo dojo saloon take barbi dream hous he get acknowledg get space mayb hook midg move mayb get beach hous beach whenev want i dont know it funni i laugh loud sever time glad i saw just wish went differ direct
"Wow, people reviewed this wrong! Especially when it comes to Ken!","Seen this as a birthday present with my mom and sister. My birthday was on the 21st, but I ended up seeing the Barbie movie on the 22nd - Joan jett's birthday, wearing my Joan Jett necklace that I had received as a birthday gift, along with my Joan Jett slash Barbie inspired outfit. So, this will go down in history as a very special movie outing for me. I felt like I was going to the actual premiere!Weird Barbie was my fave! Kate McKinnon is so attractive!! And even though they say that she was based on David Bowie, I saw a lot of Phyllis Diller in her! Yay for Weird Barbie! My other favorite character was the Barbie creator played by Rhea Perlman.Wanted to slap the kid for most of the film for being so rude to her mother and just so grumpy in general, and I felt bad for Ken. I expected that he was going to be an actual villain, but he wasn't. Based on the reviews I read and the criticisms that people had of this movie, I was expecting a really bad guy, but he was just a hurt guy. Ken just wanted as much love as Barbie had, and isn't that understandable? I really felt for him. And I like that I felt for him, because I would rather that than to hate him, the way a lot of the reviewers seem to.I adored the musical numbers! I adored the colors! And this movie was a lot more emotional than I expected. It actually made me start to cry! I was surprised.I didn't like that Barbie kept pushing Ken away though, saying that she wasn't in love with him. That's just completely against everything that the Barbie can relationship stands for - the fact is, he's her boyfriend, and eventually they do get married! I mean look at any Barbie coloring book from the '90s, and before. This whole Barbie doesn't need ken, that's just some new made up thing. She's always loved Ken and he's always loved her - that's one of the reasons why they are considered an ideal couple. So, I didn't like that part, nor did I like the part of the little girls basically beating up their baby dolls. I thought that was so crass and sad a sight. The idea that they were trying to convey could have been conveyed in a much nicer manner. But overall, a very good movie. Well done! Well done!Oh, and I almost forgot, Helen Mirren as the narrator! How wonderful a choice!!",wow peopl review wrong especi come ken,seen birthday present mom sister my birthday st i end see barbi movi nd joan jett birthday wear joan jett necklac i receiv birthday gift along joan jett slash barbi inspir outfit so go histori special movi outing i felt like i go actual premiereweird barbi fave kate mckinnon attract and even though say base david bowi i saw lot phylli diller yay weird barbi my favorit charact barbi creator play rhea perlmanw slap kid film rude mother grumpi gener i felt bad ken i expect go actual villain wasnt base review i read critic peopl movi i expect realli bad guy hurt guy ken want much love barbi isnt understand i realli felt and i like i felt i would rather hate way lot review seem toi ador music number i ador color and movi lot emot i expect it actual made start cri i surprisedi didnt like barbi kept push ken away though say wasnt love that complet everyth barbi relationship stand fact he boyfriend eventu get marri i mean look barbi color book thi whole barbi doesnt need ken that new made thing she alway love ken he alway love that one reason consid ideal coupl so i didnt like part i like part littl girl basic beat babi doll i thought crass sad sight the idea tri convey could convey much nicer manner but overal good movi well done well doneoh i almost forgot helen mirren narrat how wonder choic
Coming away a bit disappointed :/,"I was super excited to see this movie but I'm coming away from the cinema a bit disappointed. The marketing for this was amazing and everyone who watched it said that its not going to be what I expect and so my expectations were very high. There were some clever jokes and very beautiful sets and costumes but honestly the plot was hard to follow and there was nothing very nuanced or clever about the message. I think this film is a little late, maybe it would have resonated better a few years ago when these conversations were first taking place but to me it doesn't add much value to the feminist cause. It's worth seeing as it's definitely of cultural interest, but I won't be rewatching it.",come away bit disappoint,i super excit see movi im come away cinema bit disappoint the market amaz everyon watch said go i expect expect high there clever joke beauti set costum honestli plot hard follow noth nuanc clever messag i think film littl late mayb would reson better year ago convers first take place doesnt add much valu feminist caus it worth see definit cultur interest i wont rewatch
Touching and educational,"This movie should be seen by everyone in my opinion. Literally. I don't care if you don't like Barbies or pink, because this movie is so much more than that. It makes both women and men feel valid about their experiences and highlights how unequal our whole world currently is. The movie is also very comedic and has some really cool easter eggs about Barbie dolls and the development Barbie. The movie was very mature in my opinion and isn't necessarily a kids movie even though it's called ""Barbie"", a doll. It didn't have too much K18 references but sexual harassment towards the main character was present so that should be taken into account when wanting to see the film with a child.Overall, absolutely beautiful movie and really touching. It's not only about toys, it's about life.

A lot of suprises,"Most movie buffs have hated modern trailers for quite some time now. It's annoying that it often has to contain such an epic version of an existing pop song, but the worst thing is that they often show the entire film in short - and then also exactly as it goes in the film. The creators of Barbie understood that the first half hour contains enough material to use only its footage to capture the audience's interest. What follows next is a wonderful surprise.Barbie is a mirror to a major problem in society that many people don't even see in its entirety because it's so deeply ingrained.Thanks.",a lot supris,most movi buff hate modern trailer quit time it annoy often contain epic version exist pop song worst thing often show entir film short also exactli goe film the creator barbi understood first half hour contain enough materi use footag captur audienc interest what follow next wonder surprisebarbi mirror major problem societi mani peopl dont even see entireti deepli ingrainedthank
Barbie Movie: I Was Surprised!,"I was deciding on a movie to watch when eventually I decided on the barbie movie because why not, I went in thinking this would be a childish type movie but I was actually quite surprised to say the least. I can see where people are coming from with all the negativity but I personally did not mind it! The camerawork was pretty good, the acting was good though it can get cheesy at certain times, the story wasn't bad but it wasn't perfect or amazing. But the best thing about the movie is how fun it is, you can sit down after school, work, stressful or busy day and you just lay back and have a good time! I do recommend it to people who want a fun experience.

"Unfortunately, the capital B applies only to the title; otherwise it is just a C.","A difficult film to place. While it succeeds in entertaining and snatching a few healthy laughs-with quotes and jokes aimed mostly at an adept audience-it fails in my humble opinion in its underlying intention to convey a moral. The takeaways of the various Barbies, the monologues of the protoganist and her co-star are, in some ways, not only as anachronistic as they are predictable but all in all incomplete in their conclusions.The film flows on the predictable register of a tale that is at once banal and surreal, only to head toward an ultra predictable end without ever, at any time coming across any scene or joke that really captures the viewer's attention.I am not going to go into the various thorny topics addressed by the film because I think they were dealt with superficially while, if there is anything really good to point out, it was certainly the ability to confirm the importance of a serious publicity battage and how decisive the latter is in making all in all mediocre or slightly above sufficiency products achieve results that I sincerely do not think they deserve.",unfortun capit b appli titl otherwis c,a difficult film place while succe entertain snatch healthi laughswith quot joke aim mostli adept audienceit fail humbl opinion underli intent convey moral the takeaway variou barbi monologu protoganist costar way anachronist predict incomplet conclusionsth film flow predict regist tale banal surreal head toward ultra predict end without ever time come across scene joke realli captur viewer attentioni go go variou thorni topic address film i think dealt superfici anyth realli good point certainli abil confirm import seriou public battag decis latter make mediocr slightli suffici product achiev result i sincer think deserv
This started off great and then went horribly awry,"I went to see this knowing nothing and exspecting nothing. I was confused with the reference to 1001 Space Odyssey at the beginning but was thrilled with our introduction to the Barbie World. It was a feast for the eyes and a blast from the past. It brought back my childhood make believe adventures with the dolls. Margot Robbie was perfect casting for Barbie. She believably naive without being stupid. I was laughing out loud. I was thrilled with the music and dance numbers. Ryan Gosling's Ken was also adorable. It's when they enter ""the real world"" that things go terribly wrong. Every character outside Barbieland is portrayed in a juvenile manner that made it hard to watch. Then the story just fell apart. It reminded me of a bad SNL sketch where the writers had a great idea but didn't know how to land the punch line or end the skit. I really felt that having the Barbies manipulate the men into going to war to regain control of Barbieland reeked of misogyny. If this had been a play I would have walked out at intermission. I'm really shocked that Mattel let their named be used. If this movie had just stayed in Barbieland and explored more of how the dolls ""live"" I would have given this a 10.",thi start great went horribl awri,i went see know noth exspect noth i confus refer space odyssey begin thrill introduct barbi world it feast eye blast past it brought back childhood make believ adventur doll margot robbi perfect cast barbi she believ naiv without stupid i laugh loud i thrill music danc number ryan gosl ken also ador it enter real world thing go terribl wrong everi charact outsid barbieland portray juvenil manner made hard watch then stori fell apart it remind bad snl sketch writer great idea didnt know land punch line end skit i realli felt barbi manipul men go war regain control barbieland reek misogyni if play i would walk intermiss im realli shock mattel let name use if movi stay barbieland explor doll live i would given

Tried to go after many other great awakening films but with feminism-coated perspectives,"It's a fine, fun movie but will never be a classic one like 2001- or Matrix that makes you want to watch it repeatedly IMO. But definitely not a bad one.I'd like to share my perspective on the end part that seems leaving some ppl confused. Even after showing all the difficulties, obstacles, and overcome between the two sexes, the only thing that matters is that we can procreate as humans otherwise all the messages, homages, jokes, history, and thoughts shared in the film will become meaningless without human existence. I don't know much about the director but even if she is a truly thoughtful feminist or not, the challenge of sublimating all the human themes to the simplest message at the ending scene should be evaluated properly.As it went a bit dull and cliche-like throughout the film, It really looked like Barbie(Barbara) was going to have a job interview or something in that scene so was a nice unexpected ending blow to me. Yes, she seemed happy being pregnant(at least she didn't look like she had an STD to me) and it concludes the story neatly.",tri go mani great awaken film feminismco perspect,it fine fun movi never classic one like matrix make want watch repeatedli imo but definit bad oneid like share perspect end part seem leav ppl confus even show difficulti obstacl overcom two sex thing matter procreat human otherwis messag homag joke histori thought share film becom meaningless without human exist i dont know much director even truli thought feminist challeng sublim human theme simplest messag end scene evalu properlya went bit dull clichelik throughout film it realli look like barbiebarbara go job interview someth scene nice unexpect end blow ye seem happi pregnantat least didnt look like std conclud stori neatli
<3,"LOVED IT. Truly an amazing movie. A lot of people would maybe say that it's boring but to me it was super super cool, it held my attention from start to finish. Not just a movie this thing isnan experience that brings me so much joy if you go to the cinema. So many people there, dressed in pinkish clothes, feels like everyone there is happy and all of people there are unites under the idea of Barbie. The movie itself, has so many great messages to the word. I am sure a lot of little girls didn't quite understand it but they will one day. It also had so many real word/trensing things added to it.I probably liked it so much because I grew up watching old barbie movies, and now it felt like Barbie has grown with me, especially cause the topic of the movie was very real in todays world.Going in before the movie I thought it would turn out to be just ""okay"" since I saw a lot of parts from it as trailers I thought ""oh I alredy saw it all"", nahh, little did i know. Those trailers are nothing compared to this.I really reccomend watching it. But there are some parts that are ""not for kids""(ex.
